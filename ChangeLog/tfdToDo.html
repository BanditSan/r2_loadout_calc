    <h1>Will Do:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Finish the rest of the character calcs.</li>
        <li>Finish expanded weapon calcs by adding reload factors for approximate DPS values.</li>
        <li>Optimizer: those familiar with the R2 optimizer probably expected this, but like the R2 optimizer we'll set something up that can look through millions and billions of combinations to get you the best possible mod/component/weapon combos for the best dmg possible, or another stat it doesn't have to be damage.</li>
        <li>Finish URL Persistence: The URL already acts like a "save" file for your build, but it doesn't include character-specific settings like whether to include a buff nor not yet. Low priority, but this will get finished when I settle on a character structure in the code, in turn letting me settle on a URL structure for their settings.</li>
    </ul>

<div>
    <h1>Might Do: (or Extremely low priority tasks)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I'll add things here later as I think of them</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Will Not Do:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Expanded builds sharing logic</li>
        <li>Accounts/sign-ins(with the singular exception of allowing loadout saves in the cloud instead of locally later, possibly, but likely no)</li>
        <li>Anything that far exceeds the bounds of a <i><b>calculator</b></i></li>
    </ul>
