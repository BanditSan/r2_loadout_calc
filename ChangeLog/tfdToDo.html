    <h1>Will Do:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>God there is so much to do right now, it's hard to list EVERYTHING. However the priority right now is to add more character calcs.</li>
        <li>Expanded Weapon Calcs: We already have a super simple weapon damage breakdown now, but I need to get a more comprehensive breakdown added, as well as add the rest of the unique weapon abilities.</li>
        <li>Optimizer: those familiar with the R2 optimizer probably expected this, but like the R2 optimizer we'll set something up that can look through millions and billions of combinations to get you the best possible mod/component/weapon combos for the best dmg possible, or another stat it doesn't have to be damage.</li>
        <li>Finish URL Persistence: The URL already acts like a "save" file for your build, but it doesn't include character-specific settings like whether to include a buff nor not yet. Low priority, but this will get finished when I settle on a character structure in the code, in turn letting me settle on a URL structure for their settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Might Do: (or Extremely low priority tasks)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I'll add things here later as I think of them</li>

<div>
    <h1>Will Not Do:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Expanded builds sharing logic</li>
        <li>Accounts/sign-ins(with the singular exception of allowing loadout saves in the cloud instead of locally later, possibly, but likely no)</li>
        <li>Anything that far exceeds the bounds of a <i><b>calculator</b></i></li>
    </ul>
