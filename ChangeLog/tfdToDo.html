    <h1>Will Do:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>God there is so much to do right now, it's hard to list EVERYTHING. However the priority right now is to add more character calcs.</li>
        <li>Weapon Calcs: this is lower priority in comparison to character ability breakdowns, but weapon calcs are in the future too.</li>
        <li>Optimizer: those familiar with the R2 optimizer probably expected this, but like the R2 optimizer we'll set something up that can look through millions and billions of combinations to get you the best possible mod/component/weapon combos for the best dmg possible, or another stat it doesn't have to be damage.</li>
        <li>Tooltips: these were lower priority when throwing all this together, however the infrastructure from the R2 side of the site is here and it won't take much to get those up and running over here</li>
        <li>Ability Statistics: I'm not talking about damage breakdowns, I'm talking about how in game when you look at an ability it shows the range, the cooldown, the power modifier, etc. I want to add these to every skill and transcendant skill, but this is a bit of work to do.</li>
        <li>URL Persistence: Like the R2 calc, I'll make it so all the options you choose, all the mods, components, selections etc. will all be saved within the URL so you can functionally "save" your build by just copying the link that populates in your bar.</li>
        <li>Comparisons: not quite like the optimizer, think of it like a baby version of it that will let you compare two mods and it'll tell you how much a % gain one mod is over the other.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Might Do: (or Extremely low priority tasks)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I'll add things here later as I think of them</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Will Not Do:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Expanded builds sharing logic</li>
        <li>Accounts/sign-ins(with the singular exception of allowing loadout saves in the cloud instead of locally later, possibly, but likely no)</li>
        <li>Anything that far exceeds the bounds of a <i><b>calculator</b></i></li>
    </ul>
