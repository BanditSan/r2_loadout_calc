    <h1>Might Do: (or Extremely low priority tasks)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Add fragment level specification so people aren't forced into Mythic level assumptions. This is kind of a cancerous task though, and not really worth it. If I do end up doing this, and can't find the values for all levels, I might have to allow user input to specify level values but it just seems like a pedantic amount of customization, and if I do that then what next? Allowing weapon level specification? Blegh, no</li>
        <li>Add a relic usage factor setting for things like Ankh of Power instead of assuming the relic is always being used.</li>
        <li>Add melee usage factor setting for things like Butcher's Fetish</li>
        <li>Add some form of HP% sliders, to dictate player health, for things like Death's Embrace/Downward Spiral. Also would make things like Restriction Cord modify the slider input capacity, etc.</li>
        <li>Stamina usage rotation factors for things like Gift of Euphoria. On top of that, if we can ever get 100% accurate individual attack lengths, handling for how much stamina you'd get back from Matriarch's Insignia.</li>
        <li>Health cost factors for things like Burden of the Warlock</li>
        <li>"Taking Damage" factors</li>
        <li>Mod power gen/regen factors, stuff like Necklace of Flowing Life or Dense Silicon Ring</li>
        <li>Ammo reserve factors</li>
        <li>Add bleed check to Death Sentence</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Will Not Do:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Expanded builds sharing logic</li>
        <li>Accounts/sign-ins(with the singular exception of allowing loadout saves in the cloud instead of locally later, possibly, but likely no)</li>
        <li>Anything that far exceeds the bounds of a <i><b>calculator</b></i></li>
    </ul>
