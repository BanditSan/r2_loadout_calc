    <h1>Sept 30, 2024 - THE DLC3 UPDATE</h1>
    This DLC added a lot of new things and functionality. If you see anything jank or broken, please join the discord and let me know so I can get it fixed.
    <ul>
        <li>Added all new items, prism options, and adjustments from DLC3
            <li>Not all legendary prism perks have their math hooked up just yet, but I'm workin on it.</li>
            <li>Melee Damage for the fists and ultra greatsword have been set to 0 until we can get better data on their movesets, as I don't want to mislead anyone on the numbers there.</li>
        </li>
        <li>Added a shield cap of 100% of max HP, to match the new in game functionality. This cap can only be modified by the Defensive Measures legendary prism perk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>July 25, 2024 - THE MULTI-TARGET DPS UPDATE</h1>
    I ended up redoing a lot of my code with this one. You could practically carbon date my code and learning progress by going through and looking at how I handled some things, and some code has persisted since the day I started converting the spreadsheet to this project. Ideally you shouldn't see as many war-crimes in my code now, but before there were definitely a few places I left untouched for quite a long time.
    <ul>
        <h2>MAIN CALCULATOR</h2>
        <h3>Changes & Additions</h3>
        <li>Added the following new damage breakdowns as possible displays when equipped:
            <ul>
                <li>Firestorm (Mod)</li>
                <li>Heatwave (Mod)</li>
                <li>Way of Kaeula (Invoker)</li>
                <li>Heavy Weapon: Vulcan (Engineer)</li>
                <li>Heavy Weapon: Flamethrower (Engineer)</li>
                <li>Heavy Weapon: Impact Cannon (Engineer)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Displays and/or descriptions will now adjust values in the description(where applicable) based on your currently available stats for:
            <ul>
                <li>Skill Duration</li>
                <li>Skill Cooldowns (CDR)</li>
                <li>Skill Charges (only on skills that actually have charges, and only when the resulting charge value would be greater than 1 either naturally or due to items/effects)</li>
                <li>Heavy-Ammo Regen Rate(Obviously specific to Engineer skills when selected, in place of cooldowns where they would display.)</li>
                <li>AOE/Aura Range in meters. (that one was annoying)</li>
                <li>Consumable Duration (for both concoctions and quick-use)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Reworked how the active display section(when clicked) works for archetypes:
            <ul>
                <li>Now it will show their passives images as well as the prime perk image if the section is for archetype one.</li>
                <li>Given the above, instead of listing out every single aspect for the archetype, simply click on the associated image(prime perk, ability, passives 1-4) and it will open up a display for that associated section, including a calculation slider toggle just like before, and a description.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following settings toggles to save to the URL parameters, as well as queries results export links:
            <ul>
                <li>Use Weakspots</li>
                <li>Enable Crits</li>
                <li>Use Main Swings (Melee only)</li>
                <li>Use Bonus Effects (Melee only)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Not added to the URL params, but IS a new toggle, is "Use Turret Mode" which is purely for dictating what side of damage calcs you want for engineer turret skill breakdowns.</li>
        <li>Added or adjusted the following display statistics to the main stat column:
            <ul>
                <li>Added: Relic Charges (will only display when the charge amount would be anything other than the default of 10)</li>
                <li>Added: Relic Use-Chance (0% meaning no chance to use, 100% meaning guaranteed). Also added the corresponding counter effect to Gift of the Unbound vs Departed.</li>
                <li>Status Duration: changed to display as the multiplicative value it is - all status duration sources are multiplicative against the others, they are not additive. So if you have a status duration of 5s, and then Timekeeper's and Affliction, that's 2 separate bonuses of a 100% increase, meaning it gets changed from 5s to 10s, and then from 10s to 20s, meaning that 2x 100% increases is a 400% status duration value(1base * 2 * 2 = 4).</li>
                <li>Added a tooltip for HASTE in the main stat column.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the bonus Blight resistance to a custom conditional tied to Navigator's Pendant and its Rusted variant when paired with Navigator's Helm, and updated the description for both amulets to elaborate on it.</li>
        <li>Added handling to and worked out the math for Ring of Ordnance the Engineer ring. This thing *might* be bugged in-game given how it actually works, we'll have to see later, but for now we have the math. Updated the item's description as well to clarify the regen rate modification.</li>
        <li>Added regex color tagging to Alchemist ability descriptions, for Stoneskin, Frenzied, and Living Will.</li>

        <h3>Fixes/Optimization</h3>
        <li>Mobile Specific Fixes:
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed an issue where all toggles were considerably less responsive to touch than they should have been. This was an issue that arose when I added tooltips that displayed on clicks/taps, and I improperly set the required touch time to much longer than it should be, but that is fixed now. This will make mobile tooltips a bit more touchy, but let me know if you have any issues with them.</li>
                <li>Fixed an issue where an expanded damage breakdown's header was not wrapping properly if the name was huge(like say, Heavy Weapon: Impact Cannon) and caused displays to go outside of established screen bounds.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where certain consumable/concoction based items did not provide their bonuses properly, due to the consumable rework I implemented in the updates prior. The items specifically being:
            <ul>
                <li>Brewmaster's Cork</li>
                <li>Ring of Spirits (I know mod power gen doesn't display on the user side of things yet, but it will later. Just know that the back-end handling for it exists which is why I mention this item at all, it's just not ready yet)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added or adjusted the following values on the following items:
            <ul>
                <li>Tormented Heart: missing relic speed.</li>
                <li>Ritualist's Dark Blood: missing +50 Blight Resistance</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Adjusted the following item names or descriptions:
            <ul>
                <li>Skewer 2.0: name was missing "2.0"</li>
                <li>Summoner's Ruthless: description typo</li>
                <li>Timewave: description typo</li>
                <li>Hyperconductor & Invoker's Visionary: Replaced "doubled" in descriptions with "+100%", in regards to Skill Charges and Heavy Ammo bonuses.</li>
                <li>Power Saver: missing description.</li>
                <li>Brawler's Pride: missing mention of crit chance bonus in description(not the stats, just the description)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the following stats were displaying in the stats column even when they had their default value and should have been hidden(if a value would ever show as default, or essentially nothing, we don't usually add a visual row for it):
            <ul>
                <li>Max Health & Base Health (Health)</li>
                <li>Evade Price (Stamina)</li>
                <li>Unique Multi (Damage)</li>
                <li>Status Duration % (Outgoing Status)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a concoction/quick-use usage toggle was triggered, it would not retain focus on the given consumables display section. We'd actually fixed this issue when an consumable was altered or removed, but I neglected to add the fix to when a toggle was triggered as well until now.
            <ul>
                <li>Do note though that if a consumable is removed from a slot, the assigned toggle usage state associated with it will be deleted, or set to "use" as well. This is intended.</li>
                <li>Swapping the consumable instead of removing it first, will retain the usage setting associated with that given slot.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue similar to above where when a trait level was modified, or a general setting was toggled, it would defocus whatever the last item display was that you had opened. Now the item displays will stay open, whatever you last opened.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where HASTE's name did not display properly within the main stats column.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Death's Embrace was not providing the bonus 10% All Damage for being below 50% health like my modified description said it would, when selected.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Fire Rate was treated as a "fire" elemental stat for the sake of coloring, in the main stats colomn.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where inside a melee DPS breakdown display, when listing all sources relevant to a given category (dmg, crit chance, etc.) it was possible for the UI to list a source twice, so in the case of Crystal Staff if you had Shock Damage active, it would list Shock Damage in two different rows. This did not apply twice in the damage calcs, it was just a UI goof.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if Gift of the Unbound was equipped with any other burdens, even if you disabled the burden ring you had equipped, GotU would still provide a countered burden effect to negate it, when ideally it should only counter the effect if the ring is actually enabled to provide it. Now it works how it should, though this was a fairly niche scenario that I doubt anyone actually ran into.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if, say 4 concoction slots were open, and you inserted a concoction selection into slot 4 instead of slot 1, it could pop an error and fail to do it. Now if you try that it will forcibly shift the inserted concoction into the lowest available slot, removing that issue.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where item boxes did not always fill the image to fit their display fully, namely on consumable boxes.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the archetype icon, within the archetypes display box when actively opened, could be clipped on the left side. Should display properly now.</li>
        <li>Greatly trimmed down on the code required for URL handling, specifically regarding item-usage toggles. This isn't something that should effect you at all, it just unified the values that both imports and the URL updates have in common making it much easier to expand upon url parameters and settings in the future.</li>
        <li>Finally got around to adding proper handling for archetype combo titles. I'd been pulling from a huge list of all possible combos that I made back when this was a spreadsheet, but with what I just added it makes maintaining that much less cancer in the future if more archetypes are added. This also means that if just one archetype is selected, and it is the primary archetype, it will now display the prime perk as the combo title, like the game does. Before I'd just have it show blank.</li>
        
        

        <h2>QUERIES/OPTIMIZER</h2>
        <h3>Changes & Additions</h3>
        The biggest and coolest change by far aside speed stuff we'll talk about later, is this:
        <li><b>Added the ability to target MULTIPLE DPS SOURCES AT ONCE.</b> Wanna know what the best gear is when using Havoc Form AND Firestorm AND Sandstorm AND Way of Kaeula? You can absolutely fuckin do that now!
            <ul>
                <li>This option has replaced ability/item-specific targets, with the options of "DPS (Custom)" and "Total Damage (Custom)" and after you select either of those as a target stat, beneath the target stat will be a list of all possible damage breakdowns, given the gear you have LOCKED</li>
                <li>Whatever damage you want to include in the custom target needs to be LOCKED in its given slot. If you wanna target Sandstorm, Monolith needs to be locked as a primary. If you wanna target Firestorm, Firestorm needs to be locked as either a Primary or Secondary Mod slot, etc.</li>
                <li>Also note that even if locked, it is not automatically included. You MUST toggle the DPS factor ON, underneath the target stat, while the target stat is selected to be a custom target.</li>
                <li>Lastly, some damage targets can only be used in DPS target searches, but not Total Damage target searches. This is because the total damage of that given breakdown is potentially infinite, and as such there is no point in trying to quantify it.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following targets as searchable within queries, now all under the DPS or Total Damage general target stat:
            <ul>
                <li>Melee Damage [dps-only] - We'd added this to the main calc, but we hadn't made them searchable yet, now they are.</li>
                <li>Abilities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Way of Kaeula (Invoker)</li>
                        <li>Heavy Weapon: Vulcan (Engineer) [dps-only]</li>
                        <li>Heavy Weapon: Flamethrower (Engineer) [dps-only]</li>
                        <li>Heavy Weapon: Impact Cannon (Engineer) [dps-only]</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>(NEW) Mod Damage, this took a bit of trickery to get set up properly given how mods can function in general mod slots and built-in on weapons, but I got it all set and here is what we have targetable so far:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Firestorm</li>
                        <li>Heatwave</li>
                        <li>Sandstorm (Monolith Mod)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following general, non-damage based targets as searchable within queries:
            <ul>
                <li>Stamina</li>
                <li>Stamina/s</li>
                <li>Shield%</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the option to enable/disable what I will call Smart Skips or filters. These are basically like item dependencies for the query to see if a combo should be skipped because it has virtually no chance of being good. An example would be a combo that has Generating Band as a ring in one of the slots, but no items in the entire rest of the combo can provide shields. And since Generating Band only gives its bonus when you DO have shields, that means Generating is wasting a ring slot, and no matter what your target for the query it is guaranteed to be better if we replace that slot, so that combo gets skipped completely without checking what its stats might have been.</li>
        <li>Added the option to disable weight optimizations on armor searches for each combo during a query. This will default to on, as in always optimize, meaning that if a query sees a combo with overcapped DR, and the armor could be lighter, it will instead provide you with the lightest armor possible within your specified weight range, that will also put you to the DR cap of 80% total. If it can't find armor that is lighter and can do that, it will instead default to the highest armor value possible within your specified weight range.</li>
        <li>Increased the max-query-length limit from 10 billion to 1 TRILLION. What allows us to make this change, is discussed in the optimizations notes below.</li>
        <li>Updated how query "Remaining Time" estimates are handled. It's not gonna be perfect, given the nature of multithreading, and sometimes it's gonna look like your steam download speeds and be all over the place, but it's more accurate than it was before after we added multithreading and broke it.</li>
        <li>Added tooltips to each display section of an active query. Not sure what an item is just based on its image while the query is running? Just cursor over it now and it'll show you the name and what the item does.</li>
        <li>Added Weakspot/Crit toggles to Damage Settings.</li>
        <li>Added Melee-specific Swings/Effects toggles to Damage Settings. Note that settings require one to be active, it is not possible for you to disable both without the calc turning the other on.</li>
        <li>Moved the active display for concoctions and quick-use consumables to be on the same row instead of on separate ends of the active display. This row will wrap when overflowed.</li>
        <li>Moved archetype/ability selection and toggles to the Traits settings box and renamed the Traits box to Archs & Traits</li>
        <li>Added a background image to the queries display section to make it less bare-bones when it is midprocess.</li>
        <li>Added a hover tooltip under the target stat section to display all currently supported damage calculations and try to help explain how to work with the DPS or Total Damage target stat, regarding how to populate the available breakdowns with locks.</li>
        <li>Added a HealthCap tag to Broken Heart. Still not certain if I want to have it do what restriction cord does yet, in terms of modifying health, but at least will show up in queries that use that stat, so that way, now with smart filters being a thing, Broken Heart can fulfil the half health requirement for some items that might need it.</li>
        <li>Updated handling on how a thread will terminate if too many threads are opened(when more threads exist than the main thread and your CPU can keep up with). There were some instances where a thread could terminate without giving it enough time to confirm it should shut down. Weirdly enough this actually resulted in a slight speed increase on queries where it wasn't even an issue, don't ask me why because I have no idea lol.</li>
        <li>Added a text display to warn users about which browser they run queries on. Queries are optimized for Google Chrome, any other browser is not guaranteed to run at the speeds I vouch for.</li>
        <li>Renamed the Debug Mode setting to Disable Query Length Limit (Bad Idea) instead. If you want to disable the length limit, now you can, due to us resolving memory issues which we'll talk about next. That doesn't mean that it won't take until the heat death of the universe if you try to run a 27 septillion query.</li>
        <li>Under stat filters, renamed all resistance-based stats to Resistance-(type) instead of (type) Resistance just to bundle them better, alphabetically.</li>

        <h3>Fixes/Optimization</h3>
        <li>Optimized speeds by quite a lot.
            <ul>
                <li>My "testing" benchmark query of 15,941,440 combos takes 23s now, it used to take 58s, <b>that's about a 152% speed increase!</b></li>
                <li>Added armorPing results caching(only within a given query thread's active session, not locally on your device storage) to help skip armor's binary search where needed. This was a fairly large increase in speed</li>
                <li>Many, many other very small changes just about everywhere in my code, to try and make this faster.</li>
                <li><b>This also marks my end of support for the Firefox Browser, on the Optimizer.</b> This isn't to say it won't work going forward because it will, but Firefox is aids to work with and queries can be up to 2,000% SLOWER on firefox than on chromium browsers. I hate Firefox, and given that nobody is paying me for this shit I'm just gonna stop trying to optimize for it because it is simply not worth it. This also doesn't mean that I can't circle back to it eventually, only that I don't care to do so right now.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Greatly reduced memory costs involved with each thread, by about a 50% reduction per thread. (From 150-250MB/thread down to 50-125MB/thread. The cost at any given moment depends on how much a thread has in queue, and what calculations it has to handle.) A lot of this was by fixing misc bugs, but this is also in part to shifting some code to be in separate files rather than bundled into necessary files for queries, like for example the archetype combo title handling and info as we mentioned before was a huge list before the rework, but we've not only reworked it but removed it from any query related files and put it into its own.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where massive queries(way beyond normal limits) could cause a memory leak within each individual thread. This problem was the main reason for why we had a query length limit of 10 billion, and now that the issue is gone we can technically remove this limit now if we want to.
            <ul>
                <li>That said, this doesn't change the fact that massive queries can still take as long as the heat death of the universe given just how many combinations are possible with loose and/or no restrictions. Given the massive speed increase, and elimination of all known memory issues, we increased it like we mentioned before to 1 trillion.</li>
                <li>Also fuck this bug, in all its entirety. It has been the bane of my existence and I could NOT figure it out for the longest time and I am so glad it is dead.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where a locked mod slot on a ranged weapon could pop an error if the mod were outside of a given stat filter.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where a locked mod/mutator on a secondary weapon, could shift to and overwrite whatever was on the primary weapon if the primary weapon didn't have a lock in play.
            <ul>
                <li>Initially, part of this was intended behavior. It WAS meant to shift things to a diff slot if that slot was both empty, lockless, and the filters have prevented that slot from getting anything into it at all. However that can obv cause problems so I've just done away with it, and this bug which was a bit diff than the intended idea, but was a result of it.</li>
                <li>This was exclusive to Ranged Mods and Ranged Mutators, as they are the only thing in the game that can be equipped in functionally different slots but still share the same filters, just not the same locks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where blank locks could pop an error on some query types. Did an overall handling change to hopefully prevent any blank locks from popping errors again.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where disabling a passive for secondary archetypes in search settings, did not actually disable the passive's calculations.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the displayed concoction results for a given loadout, while queries were active, did not reset the entire concoction display when changed. This meant a result could have 2 concoctions and change the images to show for 2, but if the next best result updated the display and had 1 concoction to show, then the first conc image would update but the second conc image would still show the second concoction from the old result.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error that could show up in heavily filtered queries. This error didn't actually cause any problems, in fact it's a good thing that it showed up because it means things were being handled correctly in some very niche cases, but all the same I have added handling to make it so this error will never show on the user side again.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue similar to the entry above this one, where it wasn't doing any harm, and this error only ever showed up in your browser console after selecting an archetype in query settings, but is also something I added handling for so the error will never pop again.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Brewmaster's Cork's DR bonus was always one concoction short when done within queries. This issue's cause is similar to the issue that caused it to not provide DR at all on the main calc as mentioned above, regarding the consumable rework from last update.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where "Include NonStandard DR" when toggled did not always factor into the calculations.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where locking the following items could tank query speeds down to hell:
            <ul>
                <li>Edgelord</li>
                <li>Neckbone Necklace</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where other toggled settings, while they would calculate correctly in the queries, would not get added to the export URL correctly when viewing query results links.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the following items, if ever used as a lock or occlusion filter, could not be removed from the filters after being added, due to improper handling/escaping of double "" marks:
            <ul>
                <li>AS-10 "Bulldog"</li>
                <li>XMG57 "Bonesaw"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the Spirit Healer Stacks assumption setting was still capped at 10 instead of 20 like it should have been.</li>
        <li>Greatly improved handling and optimization for how Gift of the Unbound works. As one option among many you wouldn't really notice it on query speeds, but the handling for it was pretty outdated in terms of my coding practices, and if a query ever did include it then it was ever so slightly slower because of it.</li>
        <li>Did a general pass on all items with conditional functions, and tried to improve efficiency where possible.</li>
        <li>Greatly reduced the amount of code required for initial combo generation and filtering mechanisms, before batches start getting processed and sent to threads. This isn't going to change anything in terms of speeds although it may speed up the setup process by a hair(but it was already almost instantaneous leading up the armor stuff), this was mostly for myself and to clean up code in case anyone ever looked at it because that code was a Geneva Convention violation honestly.
            <ul>
                <li>This was also a rework to how it was handled, and ideally this should prevent category-specific issues with locking that we've had in the past, in particular ranged mutators were always a problem child and hopefully since they all have uniform handling now, we should never see those issues again.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if you were a psychopath and selected a billion traits, it didn't properly overflow into a scroller box to display all the selected traits, and instead it was condensing them into the box without expanding it. You know who you are.</li>
        <li>Slight optimization by removing resistance calculations, though not quite what you would think. Initially I had believed that there were actual percent increases on resistance, but they're all flat increases and I have known that for a long time now but kept forgetting to get around to removing some of the code I had in place that would have allowed for a touch more advanced calcs involving those. Very small difference on query times, but it is one less thing it has to process on each combination.</li>

        <h2>BOSS ATTACKS PAGE</h2>
        <h3>Fixes</h3>
        <li>Fixed an issue where player elemental resistance values did not calculate properly on attacks that did not ignore DR. I simply forgot to add a "/100" on the resulting value, since the values we go off of in-game are whole numbers but despite that they are actually representing percents and need to be converted to decimals.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>July 6, 2024 - LAST ACTIVE PATCH BEFORE DLC3</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Made the "Vash's Builds" page prettier. I initially threw the page up just to slap a list in there, didn't really care how it looked. It still doesn't look super amazing or anything, but I at least formatted the page instead of having it be a near empty page with nothing in it but bullet points.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where after modifying a consumable or concoction on the Calculator, the item's display section would be hidden until you clicked on its loadout slot again.</li>
        <br>This will be the last active patch I do before DLC3, for the Remnant section of the site. This isn't to say that I will stop working on it entirely because I'll fix bugs as you report them, but until DLC3 approaches I will no longer be actively working on the Remnant 2 section nor looking for things to improve in it. I can only do so much while unpaid in the name of "fun" before I start losing my fucking mind.<br>On top of that I think I've gotten most everything done that I set out to do before then anyhow. We prettied up the calc, we got the optimizer rolling, we started on dmg calcs and even got melee calcs out even if I'm not 100% satisfied with what I've had to do with them, etc. Just gonna work on other things now, like maybe other parts of the site for other games, who knows.
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>July 5, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added a shit-load of tooltips to the Calculator's display statistics.</li>
        <li>Renamed the "Healing" section to "Health" in the main stats, and added the following statistics:
            <ul>
                <li>Health Reduction: for %HP modifiers that DO modify your true Max Health, like Burden of the Mesmer.</li>
                <li>Health Cap: for %HP limits like Restriction Cord that modify your maximum allowed health but do not actually modify your true Max Health.</li>
                <li>Max Health: for the true Max Health value used by Shields and Healing effects</li>
                <li>Capped Health: for the end total HP value used for general EHP aside from Shield EHP.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following statistics to the Stamina section in the main stats:
            <ul>
                <li>Weight Penalty%</li>
                <li>Evade Cost%</li>
                <li>Evade Price</li>
                <li>Melee Cost%</li>
                <li>Renamed "Stamina Cost" to "General Cost" as the name was semi misleading. It acts as a multiplier against any given action cost, while action specific costs are separate from that.</li>
            </ul>
        </li> 
        <li>Added a Grey Health section to the main stats column and added the following statistics to it:
            <ul>
                <li>Grey Health/s</li>
                <li>Grey Health Hit Threshold</li>
                <li>Grey Health Conversion Rate</li>
            </ul>
        </li>   
        <li>Moved Relic Speed to the Action Speed section, and separated Consumable Use Speed from Relic Speed as a new statistic in that same section.
            <ul>
                <li>If anyone is confused on why, consider that while all Consumable Speed bonuses are also Relic Speed bonuses, not all Relic Speed bonuses are also Consumable Speed bonuses.</li>
                <li>Along with this change, I added the new Consumable Speed stat to all items that use it, including the trait "Glutton".</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following statistics to the Misc section of the main stats column:
            <ul>
                <li>Consumable Duration%</li>
                <li>XP% or Experience</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added handling to include sources of Corroded or Exposed to the All Damage tooltip, in the main stats column of the Calculator. While they were still being calculated before, these status sources would never show under the All Damage tooltip, only their respective status tooltips.</li>
        <li>Added handling to extend the "Use Weakspots" and "Enable Crits" toggle's effects on the Calculator, to the Havoc Form and Sandstorm breakdowns, regarding enabling crits (those two obviously can't weakspot). Now all currently supported breakdowns can use these toggles.</li>
        <li>On the Boss Damage page, added URL parameter handling so you can link a specific boss config and display, to another person. External sources can also use this to link to a specific boss if they want.</li>
        <li>Flipped Relic/Consumable Use Speed to a positive value, and renamed it in the main column from Time to Speed. I'd technically listed any increase in speeds as a negative value up until now, but that was just because I wasn't positive how relic usage duration was calculated. Now that I know, it should be positive.</li>
        <li>Updated Juggernaut's Stamina Cost bonus to be a Melee Cost bonus, because it is.</li>
        <li>Removed Dodge Class from the Stamina section. You guys all know your colors, it reflects in both the total weight font color and within the total weight tooltip.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Glutton's level 3 effect was off by a decimal point, but only the level 3 effect lol.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that could cause healing-specific queries in the optimizer to output no values</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where locked ranged mutators could queries to fail to start.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where an error could pop(it was harmless, wouldn't prevent anything from running) if you had more query threads enabled than you did possible combos. Each query thread can handle 100k combos at a time, and if you had more threads prepared than combos would allow for it would pop that, that's all.</li>
        <li>Back-end changes to greatly simplify how the main stats column populates its statistics. Also makes it much easier to add stats to display along with custom tooltips for each individual one if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>July 4, 2024 - THE MELEE DAMAGE UPDATE</h1>
    As with every major addition, be on the lookout for bugs. If you find any or just have feedback to give, join the discord linked at the bottom of any page, and ping me with it, you have my blessing to do so.
    <ul>
        <li>Added melee weapon damage/dps to the Damage Breakdown section of the calculator
            <ul>
                <li>Note that these are not iterable within build queries/optimizer yet. Getting them calculable is one thing, getting them iterable is another, and that will come next.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added settings to enable/disable weakspot and critical hits.</li>
        <li>Added info to Fission Strike's description to elaborate on the 25% multiplier better</li>
        <li>Updated World's Edge base damage. Somehow I'd modified the crit values and such but neglected to change the base damage lol.</li>
        <li>Updated Fathomless Deep's stagger values</li>
        <li>Updated handling for Shielded Strike. We'd long believed it was bugged, since the damage values didn't line up with the description. However the description is just extremely vague. It turns out the dmg bonus is based on the %shield active on your hp bar not the %max provided by the mutator, meaning without 100% shield you will not get the full 25% damage bonus and in practice, so with the shield from Shielded Strike alone, it will only reach half or 12.5% dmg bonus when at that 50% shield.</li>
        <li>Updated Overdrive's crit damage bonus from the lvl 10 effect to reflect the true increased value.</li>
        <li>Updated Fracture's description to clarify its interaction with Burden of the Gambler.</li>
        <li>Updated Acid Stone, Fire Stone, and Grounding Stone's bonuses.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where certain UI actions could refocus the window on a given item's input selector, when the action wasn't relevant to focusing that item selector element.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the armor selection UI's display values could show as "undefined" when armor pieces were selected in that slot and then removed with nothing to replace them.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if Mirage was selected as a melee weapon, its name could sometimes display as Nightshade instead. You can tell I copy-pasted at one point lmao.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where locked rings used in build queries could shit the bed after the latest changes.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>June 29, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added base statistics for ranged weapons. These will now display when a given ranged weapon is selected (dmg, range, magazine, etc)</li>
        <li>Added base information for Polygun and its mod.</li>
        <li>Added additional URL handling to shorten URL parameters where possible. This does not change how imports/exports work, this is purely to shorten links that are sourced from the site. The modified parameters in question are:
            <ul>
                <li>Archetypes & Abilities</li>
                <li>Armor</li>
                <li>Amulets & Rings</li>
                <li>Concoctions & Quick-Use Consumables</li>
                <li>Relics & Relic Fragments</li>
                <li>Weapons, Mods, and Mutators</li>
                <li>Traits</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where after the consumables restructure, consumables did not show up in tooltips when tooltips would display all items that could contribute to a given statistic. For example, Confidence Booster and Meat Shake wouldn't show up under Flat DR, now they do.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Compulsion Loop's attack speed bonus was one decimal place off, causing it to reflect lower than it should have.</li>
        <li>Updated Lifeless Heart's statistics and description to reflect the removal of any healing effect that came in DLC2, this was overlooked for a while.</li>
        <li>Removed "flat" and "%"" resistance as a statistic to filter by on queries. All non-physical resistance IS % resistance, there is no need to distinguish bewtween the two and no items even provide a separate form of resistance bonuses, they're all the same just a matter of which category. </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>June 26, 2024 - Many fixes, such wow</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to add more than 4 total quick-use consumables. You can now add as many as you would like.
            <ul>
                <li>Believe it or not this change extends to Build Queries as well. Being able to bundle as many consumables as we want, into one consumable combination, actually allows us to cut down on combinations if the given query would ever use more than 4 consumables possible. The reason for this is if 5 were usable but there were 4 slots, that meant there was more than one unique combo to be had, but if we can now fit as many as we want, that means there is now only one unique combo for consumables, ever. Not a huge deal, but for considerably more loose queries this is a hefty reduction in possible combos.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Like consumables, changed the structure for concoctions to allow for a potentially infinite amount, in case the game ever adds more items that would allow you to reach a limit higher than 7.
            <ul>
                <li>Both concoction and consumable changes, will modify the URL structure.</li>
                <li>Consumables in the URL will not be harmed by this change. Handling exists to parse even old links, when it comes to the items used.</li>
                <li>On the flip side, consumable usage toggle states WILL be erased on old links. This isn't a particularly huge deal imo, as all you need to do if you had a consumable equipped that you wanted disabled for whatever reason is just disable it again and it will be retained in the link going forward. Unlike consumable item storage, it's not particularly possible for me to add handling for old links on this due to the nature of how toggles were stored, so forgive me on that one.</li>
                <li>Fixed an issue where in the current setup, consumables could be read twice during queries, causing some weird numbers to show up that weren't realistic</li>
                <li>Fixed an issue where in the current setup, consumables did not push to the results link URLs when a query result was posted, meaning you'd click to open it and it wouldn't take the quick-use consumables with it that it should have.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Given the changes to quick-use consumables, I've removed the ability to "Lock" filter them. You can still do occlusion filters as normal, but locking just doesn't make sense anymore on those with how it works now.</li>
        <li>Changed the format, during queries, in which the main thread posts batches to the sub threads. In theory this should cut down on memory usage a little bit more, as the batches are now numbers instead of full string names, saving quite a lot of space.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where individual query threads could repeatedly post the same "best-so-far" loadout if they completed a batch without finding a loadout better than that individual thread's recorded loadout. This doesn't actually change how queries work at all and it doesn't mean any of the numbers weren't right either, this just means there won't be any dupe loadouts(note there can stil be dupe values from diff loadouts).</li>
        <li>Fixed a crazy memory leak that could happen during Build Queries when Invoker was a selected archetype. This would typically crash your browser tab whenever this happened, I have had a very hard time narrowing this one down lmao but holy shit I finally found the issue.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where trait levels could not be modified, due to a dupe prevention check I coded incorrectly a few days ago. That's my b.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where quick-use consumables 3 & 4 in the prior structure, did not save their usage toggle states to the URL. This obviously means you won't have that issue on consumable selections greater than 4 due to how we do things now as well.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where armor could be incorrectly applied to a "new best" loadout that did not fit it, in query results, meaning you'd open a result's link and it would have armor that didn't match the result's displayed statistic value.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Locked items in build queries could pop an error sometimes when an item was filtered out via stats or occlusions, but was not properly added back into the possible tables, making the query think the item didn't exist.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where on the Calc, on a fresh page load with no URL parameters, some UI components would not populate until anything was clicked or triggered at least once. This included the first concoction box, the first consumable box, and tooltips.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>June 25, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if no archetypes had been selected yet, the first Trait selector that displays by default, did not always populate with a trait list to choose from. Users could still technically type in a trait name and if it was valid then it would take, but otherwise that required users to know how to spell trait names correctly(god knows that could be a struggle for some of you)</li>
        <li>Replaced low resolution images(where applicable) with images of much higher quality(was just awkward now that we show items in much larger sizes, when an image was hella low quality), in the following categories:
            <ul>
                <li>Amulets</li>
                <li>Archetype Icons</li>
                <li>Armor</li>
                <li>Concoctions</li>
                <li>Consumables</li>
                <li>Melee</li>
                <li>Primaries</li>
                <li>Relics</li>
                <li>Rings</li>
                <li>Secondaries</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>June 24, 2024 - THE LOADOUTS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to store and load data from local storage, in regards to loadouts on the Calculator.</li>
        <li>Added a UI component just above the calc's item slot selections, to display boxes 1-10. Tapping/clicking on them will open the loadout menu associated with that loadout number.
            <ul>
                <li>If a loadout has been found in storage under that number, it'll tell you, as well as load the name of that loadout in the naming slot. You can load the loadout or overwrite it when one is found, including changing the name when overwriting.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>June 21, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Made some changes to tooltip structuring to allow to to be more modular and used outside of the context of remnant if I expand on the site.</li>
        <li>Made changes to how tooltips were handled in all pages, in relation to the prior note above. This also means all the mobile friendly tooltip changes that were made to the Calculator, are now applicable everywhere.</li>
        <li>Made more slight changes to file structure, nothing you guys would care about.</li>
        <li>Added a redirect page in case someone backspaces the URL down to /Remnant2/ instead of just using regular navigation. /Remnant2/ is a file that leads to all remnant pages, but it didn't strictly have anything to point to if you trimmed URL down to that, but now it does.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>June 20, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Base melee weapon stats will now display under the melee weapon expanded view. This is just stuff like damage, crit chance, stagger, etc.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that allowed duplicate trait entries if a user was determined enough. This was possible because while the dropdowns would exclude already selected traits, if a user manually entered in a duplicate trait, because it was still a valid trait the calc would process it accordingly. This is no longer possible.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if users entered in an invalid trait name, the calc would still try to process it like a valid one, causing some errors. Why tf weren't you just using valid traits anyhow...?</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>June 19, 2024 - THE TOOLTIPS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added tooltips to most everything now. Hover on desktop, tap on mobile. If you think I missed anything or have suggestions on things I could add tooltips to, or things I can add to the tooltips themselves, let me know.</li>
        <li>Added item listing to tooltips to display relevant selections within the loadout to that statistic. Say you have Lithic Signet equipped as a ring and you hover over Flat DR, it'll show that Lithic contributes to that stat.</li>
        <li>Added positional handling to desktop's tooltips, so they will adjust their orientation based on mouse position (Such as: displaying to the left when mouse is on the right side of the screen, or displaying above when on the bottom half, helping resolve issues where a tooltip at the bottom of the screen would extend the screen length)</li>
        <li>Added mobile adjustments to tooltips, since desktop can display on mouse position, but that doesn't work very well on mobile. Mobile tooltips will down display along the full width of the screen, and just below whatever you tapped. Tap the element again to make it go away, or tap another element elsewhere.</li>
        <li>Added handling for enemy count within Challenger's "Intimidating Presence" perk. It will now add Reduced Enemy Damage per enemy counted, up to a maximum of 4 enemies.
            <ul>
                <li>Unfortunately this does mean queries will be a TINY bit slower, since they now check for passives. We're talking a difference of like a single second though, in terms of total completion time.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Increased the Spirit Healer stack slider maximum to 30.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where a console logger for debug purposes was slowing down queries quite a lot whenever Burden of the Mesmer was iterated upon, I simply forgot to take it out before when I was using it to fix a bug, that's my bad.</li>
        <li>Fixed Spirit Healer's custom function. This was something I was aware wasn't working properly, but kept putting off as it just wasn't important to me.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Game Master's Pride DMG Split was not being applied in the UI.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>June 18, 2024 THE COMPLETED BOSS DATA UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added an option to display all attacks for all bosses.</li>
        <li>Added options to filter attacks when displaying all of them. This includes the ability to decide what attacks you want to show, and how you want to sort them.</li>
        <li>Added Elemental Resistance factoring.</li>
        <li>Added various tooltips to help explain certain aspects of the settings.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that caused world level scaling, when adjusted, to give crazy values.</li>
        <li>Unlocked the difficulty slider, now that we have a disclaimer for it.</li>
        <li>Added boss data for the following enemies:
            <ul>
                <li>Cinderclad Forge</li>
                <li>Legion</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added stagger levels and/or damage types to the following bosses that were missing them:
            <ul>
                <li>Lydusa</li>
                <li>Tal'Ratha (Physical)</li>

                <li>Venom</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added a missing attack to Astropath's moveset.</li>
        This marks the end of boss data collection: we have it all now. If you think I'm missing an attack, let me know.
        <li>Renamed the "BUILDS" header nav dropdown to "BUILD TOOLS" as builds was semi-misleading, although I do link to my builds as a whole that's not what the dropdown is meant for.</li>
        <li>Added a button next to the export to R2TK button that takes users to the build optimizer</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>BOSS ATTACKS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added boss data for the following enemies:
            <ul>
                <li>Bruin</li>
                <li>Cancer</li>

                <li>Sunken Witch</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added columns on boss attacks for the following values:
            <ul>
                <li>Damage Type</li>
                <li>Stagger Level</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Renamed the "Type" column to "Attack Type"</li>
        <li>Made it so Stagger Values can display for boss attacks if I have the info for them. Some bosses from before I already have info for, all the new bosses I added today have stagger levels, but some of the older bosses I don't have stagger for and I need to fight them again in order to get it. I'll redo those bosses last once I have damage info and now stagger levels for everything else.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>June 14, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the file necessary to display boss damage info on the Boss Damage page. This was meant to go out two days ago but I goofed and the left the file on my .gitignore so it never uploaded.</li>
        <li>Related to the prior note, I added data for a few more bosses. I believe all the world bosses should be on there, we'll work on adding stagger levels and more minibosses later.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>June 13, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Burden of the Mesmer wasn't calculating its all damage bonus properly in relation to total DR.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>June 12, 2024 SITE RESTRUCTURE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added a Remnant 2 specific navbar that will display on remnant related pages.</li>
        <li>Added a Remnant 2 home page that can link to all other remnant pages aside from the r2 navbar. This is the page you will land on if you click the r2 icon on the side-nav.</li>
        <li>Split the build calculator from the build optimizer. These now have their own separate webpages accessible from the r2 home or r2 header navbar on any r2 page.</li>
        <li>Added R2 boss damage listing. I have info for more bosses handy and ready to enter, but that will be data entry for another day. For now I'd rather get this out and get feedback and bugs on everything I just changed, before I worry about finishing the data entry for that.</li>
        <li>Remnant specific pages now follow a /Remnant2/ addition in the URL. This does mean that technically old links will break, especially since some pages were renamed, but ideally I added redirect handling to resolve that. We'll see if it actually works though.</li>
        <li>Overhauled how queries function:
            <ul>
                <li>Queries subthreads now receive batch combos from the main thread instead of having a perfectly even split in terms of the # of combos that each thread had to handle. The idea initially was to try and divide the work evenly, but that doesn't make too much sense from a numbers standpoint since not all calculations are equally intensive, meaning some threads could finish well ahead of other threads. The way it is now makes sure that all threads stay open until there is no more work left to do, then they'll close.</li>
                <li>The aforementioned change also makes it so since the main thread handles combo iteration, the sub threads no longer need to store some information, helping cut down on memory usage by a LOT. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Individual threads still have to calculate armor combos by themselves and there are still gonna be some memory issues if you run a massive and I mean MASSIVE query, but the query limit prevents you from even reaching that issue right now so it's not something you need to worry about. Just know that I am working towards trying to remove all memory issues period so we can remove the query limit as a whole if you want.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Another slight change and benefit(or at least I believe it is a benefit), is that if you pushed too many threads on your query and your computer can't keep up, when a query thread asks for a batch from the main thread and there isn't one to take, the thread will close to try and relieve some of the pressure your computer is facing.</li>
                <li>The changes implemented today should have no change on query speeds whether large or small queries are run. The only thing we've changed is how queries are handled, and the memory cost involved with running them. Ideally this will let me make it faster in the future though, we'll see.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Calculator slots, when clicked, will now autofocus the textfield relevant to that item.</li>
        <li>Made changes to various html blocks so I could insert a uniform source for commonly used sections like the sidenav and footer, etc.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>June 2, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Armor occlusions/locks to the query filters. To all you goobers who care about fashion, you can now restrict or lock whatever you'd like into your queries.
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed an issue where if the user didn't include "Armor" as a desired stat within stat tags, armor pieces were excluded entirely from queries. Forced a mandatory "Armor" tag to be present when filtering armor tables specifically so this won't happen again.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a missing image for Burden of the Mesmer</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 31, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Removed warning in Sandstorm breakdown letting users know mutators weren't factored. They are factored now.</li>
        <li>Added Primary and Secondary variants of Mod Damage and Elemental Damage as weapon specific Damage Statistics, these will populate under the basics column or under a relevant damage breakdown.</li>
        <li>Added conditional statistics to the following Ranged Mutators:
            <ul>
                <li>Failsafe</li>
                <li>Harmonizer</li>
                <li>Maelstrom</li>
                <li>Spellweaver</li>
                <li>Spirit Feeder</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Updated Failsafe's description</li>
        <li>Slight change to how unique-status count conditionals were handled (Ahanae, Maelstrom, etc.)</li>
        <li>Added handling to pre-exclude items from queries that would require a specific archetype to function, that isn't equipped. This simply serves to save you time from having to filter shit you would never use in that query. Examples would be:
            <ul>
                <li>A'Taerii Booster (Engineer)</li>
                <li>Conjurer's Circle (Summoner)</li>
                <li>Mechanic's Cog (Engineer)</li>
                <li>Ring Of Ordnance (Engineer)</li>

    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 30, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added support for Sandstorm Damage Breakdowns. Note that sandstorm breakdowns do not yet factor in gun mutators that boost the mod damage of that specific weapon it is equipped on. That's something I'll add tomorrow.
            <ul>
                <li>This shipped with a bug that could result in the DMG and DPS not displaying at all, but that has been fixed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The damage section will display buttons for each available breakdown supported. Clicking the button will expand the desired breakdown and its statistics/dps/total dmg etc. To return to the breakdown selection, click the "return to breakdown selection" button that takes the selection's place.</li>
        <li>Unhid the option to hide the damage section. Now that we're actually adding support for more than one thing, maybe you guys wanna hide that sometimes idk.</li>
        <li>Retitled the Build Queries section to be called Optimizer instead. I've had to explain to one too many people what "query" means, so hopefully for the people that struggle with that, "optimizer" will trigger that monkey neuron activation and you'll understand now. I hate people.</li>
        <li>Added the option to Hide the queries/optimizer section</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the Havoc Form damage breakdown listed "Bulwark Stacks" as a damage factor. This was mislabled and should have been listed as Shock Damage, which the number already reflected, it was simply the title that was wrong.</li>
        <li>Added the HTML base file for EHP & Boss Damage thresholds, which will get expanded upon later. It is accessed via the Resources icon(book) at the top of the calc page.</li>
        <li>Added more info to the My Builds section under the Resources Icon, mainly adding past builds for the sake of record. Also retitled that section to "My Builds"</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 29, 2024</h1>
    <ul> 
        <li>Query micro-optimizations:
            <ul>
                <li>Optimized relic specific function handling and calls during overall calls and during query cycles, this also brings them in line with how custom item functions overall work. For the longest time relics have always been a little anomalous in that regard.</li>
                <li>Made changes to cut down on the parameters necessary for custom item function calls, this is just an extension of a prior work regarding the removal of the need to distinguish between UI and query specific variables when it wasn't necessary.</li>
                <li>Condensed additional global-type variables that used to distinguish in the middle of a query, between UI or Cycles, such as useShields, useRelicHealing, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 28, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Started on the groundwork for link embeds. Much more needs to be done on this front, but I'm working to make it so it's not just a fat ass link that shows up if you post this somewhere, like say Discord.</li>
        <li>Optimized trait calls within query cycles. A slightly noticeable speed increase, but only on queries where you've imported your traits/classes(which ideally, is the only kind of query you ever do).</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where unique multipliers such as Brightstone wouldn't populate within the basic stats column properly. Unique multipliers only display in the basics column, they are not factored into any damage calculations. Yet.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 27, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed an issue where item conditional-based stats didn't always populate correctly, due to some changes I made yesterday.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where a havoc-specific query was not always functional under specific user settings.</li>
        <li>More back-end code changes made to both streamline and simplify code, as well as help speed up queries.
            <ul>
                <li>Multiplicative statistics(Reduced enemy damage, damage shared, etc.) are no longer handled as arrays with each source inside, and rather are now multiplied against eachother as they read from each item to be stored as a single value like most other statistics.</li>
                <li>Query threads no longer distinguish between what are normally main UI variables, and thread specific variables, while in the middle of cycles. This is because threads have their own unique scope, and it wasn't necessary other than to keep things separate in my own head.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 26, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Modified query results to go back to showing greater than the last target. I didn't want to do this but because damage-related queries in particular cast such a huge net, it is possible to have millions of duplicate equivalent results. Duplicate results found by multiple threads will still show, but duplicate results found within each thread will no longer be shared to the main thread that handles it all. TLDR: Less dulicate results will be shown now, in order to speed things up.
            <ul>
                <li>I believe there is a way I can still handle this without killing the speed, but it's something I'll have to add at a later time, for now this needs to be done in order to make sure queries are even usable for damage related things.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that could cause queries to crash in scenarios where the user filtered so strictly the queries couldn't return enough rings to complete a loadout, resulting in the concoction limit boost sum of a ring set to be read as a ring itself.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 25, 2024 - SPEED UPDATE #2</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Reworked entirely how the conditional hierarchy works. This is the stuff that lets something like Generating Band see if there is a shield active in order to determine whether to give healing or not. This is purely a back-end change and you guys shouldn't see anything different other than queries are about 38% faster than they were yesterday.
            <ul>
                <li>As with all major reworks, I may have missed something jank. If you see anything that doesn't make sense that might have slipped past my testing, let me know.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if the user arrived at the site without interacting with literally anything and goes straight to the queries and pops in a target and hits start without putting in any filters, it could crash the calculator.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Alchemy Stone's lifesteal was provided regardless of whether the player was suffering from a status effect(like Atonement Fold's bleed effect). Not a huge deal since it still displayed the bonus correctly, just not always in the right context.</li>
        <li>Resonating Heart's overheal effect UI element will now only display when the relic is not disabled. When disabled before, the numbers in overall calculations would adjust as they should, but the overheal UI element didn't have any resets in place and would linger when it wasn't relevant to the display.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 18, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Changed Blood Bond's trait bonus to only populate when Summoner is a selected archetype. We had discussed doing this before in light of the recent game change, but I didn't have anything set up for traits to allow custom conditionals yet, I added that today.</li>
        <li>Added custom function call handling for traits. Right now Blood Bond is the only one that uses it(All other item types already use this), but it'll be nice to have for the future since traits were designed to be static bonuses when I started this and that may not always hold true.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Resonating Heart's custom UI elements for the overheal effect did not display in some circumstances.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Monolith's Sandstorm mod was giving extra stats it should not be.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Sandstorm's EXPOSED effect could apply twice within the UI.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the basic statistics column(armor, stamina, weight, etc) took up too much space on mobile. Simply forgot to set the height to auto on mobile devices and it still tried to take up desktop height, my b.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 16, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added movement speed as a query target, and stats filter preset.</li>
        <li>Added more lifesteal target statistics to queries so that way you aren't stuck with lifesteal peak. Peak assumed you didn't care what kind of lifesteal it was, and only wanted to see the highest lifesteal possible, but now you can target what type you want (all, ranged, melee, charged melee, etc)</li>
        <li>Added handling for "Rusty" prefix weapons within the main UI and within cycles calculations. Rusty weapons cannot use a mod or mutator, this is specific to Rusty Lever Action primary, and Rusty Repeater secondary.</li>
        <li>Added a heads-up display to the Damage Section to notify users of supported Damage Calculations. Later I'll change this to a hover-tooltip when we have more supported types.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if you locked a blank slot into the locks filters of a given category via entering "--" as the locks filters section states you can, it would break when the lock was iterated upon. Now you can lock as many slots as you want, with an empty item that neither has stats or uses. This may sound weird, but there are definitely uses for this, but only on locks.</li>
        <li>Slight back-end code cleaning. Changes nothing performance related.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 15, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added images to all mutators, they'll now display in the formerly empty box in a weapon's display tab.</li>
        <li>Query results now store the top 50 builds, instead of the top 3. This was added because with the change I brought yesterday I forgot to mention that repeat value results will now show where they didn't before. I don't mean repeat builds, I mean repeat target values, so if two entirely different builds result in exactly 800 EHP on an EHP query, they'll both show up now, and stuff like that happens WAY more than you think it would lol. Before, if an equivalent target value was found, it was skipped because it wasn't greater than the target value already found.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a query was forcibly aborted due to excessive possible combos, it didn't fully reset some UI elements necessary to modify or restart further queries. The user could still get around it by clicking "abort" as the button is attached to code that would reset it properly, but now it's fixed anyways.</li>
        <li>Changed Bottom Feeder's name to Spirit Feeder like in game</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 14, 2024 - <h3><span class="haste">THE QUERY SPEED UPDATE</span> (Up to 90% faster)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Queries now offer an option to increase the number of threads on your CPU that queries can operate on. This will DRASTICALLY increase query speeds, but be sure to monitor CPU and RAM usage to make sure you didn't open too many, as while it does speed things up it also comes at a cost. Refer to your CPU's Core Count as a general rule of thumb.</li>
        <li>Given that queries can now be much faster, I've bumped the query length limit from 300 Milllion, to 10 Billion.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a user duplicated a browser tab with a target statistic selected in query settings, sometimes the target query statistic would copy over but wouldn't actually apply, resulting in the user needing to delete it and add it back before it would register again.</li>
        <li>Fixed a typo in Twisted Idol's description.</li>
        <li>Updated Dark Pact's bonuses, it still reflected the preDLC2 bonuses.</li>
        <li>Updated a few straggler Fragment bonuses I missed, like Ranged Crit Chance (10% -> 7.5%)</li>
        <li>Blood bond no longer works on anything other than summoner minions, in-game. The calculator does not reflect this in terms of calculations, but I did update Blood Bond's description to make that explicitly clear.</li>
        <li>Added tooltips to the following. Forgot what a given trait did, or even what its bonus was at a given level? Wonder no longer, they will show!
            <ul>
                <li>Traits</li>
                <li>Fragments</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added regex color filtering for GLOOM, BRITTLE, and DRENCHED from invoker abilities. Added blank(white) filtering for EXPOSED and GIFT OF THE FOREST.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 13, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Queries in progress will now only update the counter progress bar if either a new best build is found, or if the current iteration is an increment of 10,000. This helps reduce communication overhead between the web worker and the main thread, increasing query speeds by up to 25% in some cases. THAT is def gonna help on speeds, but I understand some people won't feel like it's faster since the numbers won't flick by anymore. Also note it is not guaranteed to make things any faster depending on the type of query initiated. Calculation-intensive queries might still take a little bit longer.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 12, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Adjusted Havoc Form drain rate and base damage calculations to match up with the latest game patch.</li>
        <li>Added a disclaimer in the queries section that some browser extensions may cause queries to be slower than they should be, or cause memory leaks. This is not inherent to queries themselves (I promise I didn't code any memory leaks. Yet.), the user that reported this issue narrowed it down to a very specific extension. Just be aware of that and maybe run queries in an incognito window.</li>
        <li>Slight code overhaul. This changes nothing on your end, it only serves to clean up some code on my end that relates to how queries are handled. Changed how some statistics are extracted from a given loadout in the middle of a query, for example traits never change in a query and because of that I can statically evaluate their bonuses outside of the cycles instead of evaluating them every time within. It might make things faster, I personally didn't see any difference. I am working on many things to try and speed up queries, though.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Havoc Form Damage box would display by default even without havoc selected on page load assuming no imports forced any calcs to occur, but would immediately be hidden like it should be as soon as any changes were made to the initial display.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where stamina regen displayed as a percentage multiplied by 100. This is not indicative of the actual value calculated, it only did this because on the display function that inserts stamina regen as a statistic, I accidentally left "percentage" as true which would multiply the value by 100 and add a % sign.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where kinda like stamina regen, armor DR displayed incorrectly(in format only, the number was right still don't worry), this time it was meant to be a % but wasn't displayed as such. Both of these bugs only occured because I overhauled how part of the displays work, that's my bad for not catching it sooner.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when Invoker was the only selected class, the class combo title would display as "undefined" instead of empty like it should have.</li>
        <li>Fixed an incorrect description for Shielded Strike.</li>
        <li>Updated descriptions for Brawler's Pride and Berserker's Crest, as well as their newly changed/added statistics from the latest update. Note that melee attack speed and melee charge speed are now a unified statistic in terms of how the game handles it on most items which is why you won't see "charge speed" in most descriptions anymore. Edgelord being an exception.</li>
        <li>Various other item/ability/passive adjustments from the latest game patch.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 6, 2024 - HAVOC DPS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Archon's Havoc Form calculations to the DMG section of the calculator. This will only display if havoc form is a selected ability.</li>
        <li>Added the following query target statistics:
            <ul>
                <li>Havoc Form DPS (will abort if havoc is not imported)</li>
                <li>Havoc Form Total Damage (will abort if havoc is not imported)</li>
                <li>Grey Health Regen/s</li>
                <li>Peak Lifesteal. This evaluates total % lifesteal possible, and will return the highest possible lifesteal even if it might be ranged or melee at any given build.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following stat presets:
            <ul>
                <li>Grey Health Regen</li>
                <li>Lifesteal Peak</li>
                <li>Havoc Form. Please note that damage has to cast a very large net due to things like Ahanae, or Mesmer, etc. This preset is not enough to bring you under the 300 million limit. You WILL need to filter much, much harder to get realistic query lengths. It's not a bug that you keep getting the "too many" error.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added a value to the "Query Limit Exceeded" popup so you can see just how far over 300 million you are.</li>
        <li>Made changes to queries logic that can, in some cases, make them go 20% faster(this doesn't apply to every type of query)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where in some cases, queries would not find the peak armor set available due to a rounding error. We're talking a difference of 0.2 base armor at the most, so thankfully this really doesn't change anything math-wise.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Anastasija's Inspiration was not calculating the haste benefit at the correct time in queries.</li>
        <li>Disabled the ability to import a new class set while a query is already active. This is a limitation I'll remove later, but for now it is needed.</li>
        <li>Changed the basic statistics display column to only display statistics if they were present in a given build. It technically already worked like this, but any DR related rows always populated no matter what, as did Healing or Stamina rows. Now they only show up if the user actually has a bonus in those rows that needs showing.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>May 1, 2024 - THE QUERIES UPDATE: BETA</h1>
    These are releasing in a limited capacity to start with, specific to tank-based searches.
    <ul>
        <li>Added Build Queries Beta to the live site. Please report any and all bugs you find in the discord linked at the bottom of any page.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the live site was missing a file needed in order to initiate queries, so they didn't work until I patched that in. That was my bad.</li>
        <li>Fixed a typo on Ring of Ordnance where it should be Ring Of Ordnance, this prevented the item from being imported from R2TK</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Shield EHP did not calculate properly for Restriction Cord. I'd actually fixed this before, but made an additional change that inadvertently reverted it.</li>
        <li>Updated the "Vash's Builds" dropdown tab to include recent videos.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where in some cases, queries would not find the peak armor set available due to a rounding error. We're talking a difference of 0.2 base armor at the most, so thankfully this really doesn't change anything math-wise.</li>
        <li>Changed the basic statistics display column to only display statistics if they were present in a given build.

    </ul>

<div>
    <h1>April 27, 2024 - THE DLC2 ITEMS UPDATE</h1>
    Queries are my next update. They'll release in a limited beta capacity, puretly for tank searches, for now, but that will be later and hopefully today as well but we'll see.
    <ul>
        <li>Added all DLC items(barring the Polygun, for now). If you notice anything weird with the calculations, let me know in my discord.</li>
        <li>Added a hierarchy system to items that have conditionals to ensure they apply in the correct order. In theory this shouldn't change anything as it worked before, this was only necessary so things that had conditionals based on what were normally "final" stats, like Total DR, will calculate properly. As before, if you notice anything jank, let me know.</li>
        <li>Changed incoming bleed to now be a multiplicative reduction to Healing Effectiveness, instead of additive like it was before. This is a patch change I forgot to make.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the movement speed granted by Gift of the Unbound was calculating based on the health reduction modifier from its old effect, instead of the new movement speed bonus(so it was granting 20%MS per burden instead of 5% lol)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where relic use speed wasn't displayed due to an error.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where imports from R2TK could break when an item(specifically ranged weapons) was imported that utilized a custom function.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Kolket Eyelet was giving 0.03 instead of 0.3 per Bulwark.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Soul Guard/Shard gave the incorrect bonus amounts in relation to summon count settings.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>April 23, 2024 - THE PRE-DLC PATCHNOTES PREP UPDATE</h1>
    Build Queries and Melee DMG are not included in this update. That will be after I do my DLC playthroughs.
    <ul>
        <h3><span class="haste">INTERFACE REWORK</span></h3>
        <li>Main calc UI overhaul: Condensed accessories, consumables, weapons, and all item selections into one zone which used to be only for archetype selections. This allows us to bump trait selection up to the main UI row, and delete the 2nd UI row entirely.</li>
        <li>Item toggles are now displayed within each item's "selected" state. This is when the item's loadout slot is clicked or tapped.</li>
        <li>Trait section now displays circles just like in game instead of a segmented progress bar. Trait level can be assigned through manual input, or through clicking/tapping the circle that corresponds to the desired level.</li>
        <li>Changed all Checkboxes, to Toggled Sliders. This is far more mobile friendly.</li>
        <li>Changed the site to follow the "Montserrat" Font to closer follow the game's UI</li>
        <li>Added regex filtering to include numbers within descriptions. No matter the units used(seconds, meters, %, etc) they will now be emboldened like the game UI.</li>

        <h3>CALCULATIONS & ADJUSTMENTS</h3>
        <li>Modified all item statistics and custom functions as best I could, to match pre-release patch notes. I say best I could as the patchnotes were not incredibly specific on every change that happened, some mention value changes but not how much. As such, many values remain unchained until we can get the DLC update to see what the new values are.</li>
        <li><span class="haste">HASTE</span> is now calculated and its bonuses displayed where relevant</li>
        <li>Added support for up to 4 quick-use consumables. Before I only supported 2 because I firmly believed there were never more than 2 that related to tanking, but now that we're moving beyond tanking I obviously need to change that. Rejoice, anyone who imported builds with more than 4 quick-use from R2TK.</li>
        <li>Added conditional calculations for over 40 items. If I was able to make it conditional without being too excessive, then I did it. Stuff like Alchemy Stone or even Embrace of Sha'hala no longer provide their bonuses implicitly. I tried to specify within item descriptions if the condition was assumed to always be true, so if you don't see that then you can generally assume that there is a conditional associated, but I might have forgotten a few so let me know.</li>
        <li>Added outgoing/incoming status effects, based on what your build is, for the sake of conditional calculations mentioned above. An example: Atonement Fold provides <span class="bleed">BLEEDING</span> as an incoming status to the player. The player now counts as an entity afflicted with both a negative <span class="status">STATUS</span> effect, and a <span class="bleed">BLEEDING</span> status effect.</li>
        <li>Added advanced stats settings for: Enemy Count, Grey Health Active, Perfect Dodge, Evade dodge override(otherwise it assumes it is a normal dodge/roll, not an evade/backstep)</li>
        <li>Added the distinction between stamina cost and action cost, as not all stamina cost reductions are the same thing
            <ul>So as an example:
                <li>Evades cost 25 stamina at base. Say you have 20% reduced evade cost, this is an action cost reduction, and applies to the base cost of the action BEFORE stamina cost penalties or bonuses are applied.</li>
                This logic applies to all stamina-related actions and their associated action-cost specific stats.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Removed stats from Samoflange. It used to only show the negative DR gained in the downtime, but I agree that isn't fair to do since it does have a positive. However, even if we average the DR gained over time using the bonus and the negative, you're still a hair under 0% DR gained and negative. As such, it is simplest to just stop the item from adding anything anymore. Why in the hell would you be using that thing anyways.</li>
        <li>Removed the ability to toggle calculations for relic fragments, and traits. These were mainly there for when this was still a spreadsheet so you could verify the source was providing what it should be, but for fragments all you need to do to do that is remove the fragment, and for traits just unrank them. I may add this back later if I find a good way to incorporate it into the UI that isn't pointless, but for now they go.</li>
        <li>Removed Wayfarer and Resonance, and merged them with Swiftness and Amplitude, respecitvely. Added support for multi-benefit, separately-scaling traits in the calculations.</li>
        <li>Adjusted stamina penalty calculations for Verdant Tea. It doesn't list it as such within the game, but it does reduce the weight-cost penalty. Upddated the description on my end to reflect that.</li>
        <li>Made slight changes to the overall save structure of the URL parameters. If you notice anything weird let me know immediately. It will probably screw with people who had a complex relic input saved in the URL for Resonating Heart, as that setting is now fully calculated without user input and the save slot has been replaced by enemyCount</li>

        <h3>FIXES</h3>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the trait "Bloodstream" didn't have a level 0 value defined, and as such would break the GHP/s display when selected at level 0</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Game Master's Pride was not calculating shared damage correctly. I'm amazed nobody noticed before frankly, but that was a mistake on my part.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where <span class="shield">SHIELD</span> EHP did not properly calculate when Restriction Cord was selected. This was because Restriction Cord does not actually cut your HP in half for the purposes of shielding, it only prevents you from healing past half.</li>
        <li>Fixed a typo with A'Taerii Booster where the T was not capitalized. As lower case this caused some exclusion flags when importing from Remnant2Toolkit.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where weight summary display values did not properly reflect their weight class color when they rested exactly on the cusp of a threshold.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a melee was selected that utilized a custom functcion for conditionial stats, it would prevent imports from working correclty from R2TK</li>
        
        <h3>OPTIMIZATION</h3>
        <li>Optimized code to reduce redundant formula calls. You won't even be able to notice this on the main calculator, but for Build Queries when you get them, a lot happened here. Still more to do though, this has been a learning project for me.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>March 24, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added a small banner that displays when the calc was last updated, based on the last push made to the github master branch. This is just so if an update comes to the game, and you guys are curious if I've added something, you can 1) see this changelog anyways, but 2) you can now see when the last time I touched it, was.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>March 23, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed an issue where traits with multiple benefits could freeze the calculator(Shadeskin, Handling, etc)</li>
        <li>Added missing stats for Explorer's Gold Digger ability. Note though that this means all bonuses granted by any Fountain will be considered active at all times while the ability is left toggled as on. I do not intend to add ability-bonus individual substat toggles, ability toggles themselves are already enough, use your head when abilities have more than one benefit that may not be guaranteed active at all times during ability use.</li>
        <li>Fixed descriptions still having a hyphen in "Fire-Rate", this was leftover from the old regex filter I used in substat color tagging, but is no longer necessary. </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>March 22, 2024</h1>
    <ul>Barring any crazy bugs you find that need immediate fixing, this is probably the last set of minor fixes to come, before I get damage calculations set up and rolling for at least melee.<br>
        <li>Fixed an issue where lifesteal's display values were rounding off one digit too soon. This didn't actually change the values, only the displays(not that lifesteal is even used in any calculations front-end yet, idk why I'm even clarifying)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the calculator would not recognize if it was opened from another section of the site, causing it to notify you of an import when there obviously was none</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>March 21, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed built-in melee mods not getting cleared when the weapon was no longer selected</li>
        <li>Major code overhaul: rewrote trait logic, cut out a lot of code in the process. Nothing should change on the user end, just think of it as housecleaning.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>March 20, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added built-in gun mods. As such, imports from R2TK using these will no longer flag an exclusion notification</li>
        <li>Fixed image for Dull Steel Ring</li>
        <li>Finalized regex filter used for substat color tagging. I can now add to a list of exclusions specific to substat tags, for better and more efficient handling.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>March 19, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added substat color tagging. So stuff like <span style="color: #f9ebb8;">BULWARK</span> or <span style="color: #7171a7;">OVERLOADED</span>, that kind of stuff now will adjust color accordingly within descriptions.</li>
        <li>Improved regex filter used in the aforementioned point, to exclude compounded words or words with ":" or "-". This way fire-rate does not get modified just because it has fire in it and the hyphen wasn't recognized.</li>
        <li>Added all backend statistics and custom item functions(if applicable) for the following categories. These were previously partially ignored as the skipped stats had nothing to do with tanking, EHP, or survivability in general.
            <br>Some of these additions will reflect right now, such as Shadeskin, but a lot of these don't have displays hooked up yet.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Relic Fragments</li>
            <li>Traits</li>
            <li>Concoctions/Consumables</li>
            <li>Melee Mutators</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Added array handling for traits with multiple benefits, such as Shadeskin, or Handling. This is unique to Traits as they have levels as well as properties.</li>
        <li>Added missing image for Onyx Pendulum</li>
        <li>Added missing consumable descriptions, for the items that were added yesterday</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>March 18, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added custom, dynamic item functions for amulets AND rings. So like Daredevil's Charm, Gift of the Unbound, etc. Not everything will be perfect, not everything this does is even visible right now, but it's there for later.</li>
        <li>Added missing consumables, even if they don't have a place yet.</li>
        <li>Change settings Toggles icon to orange because people are blind and didn't know it existed. TELL ME YOU CAN'T SEE IT NOW.</li>
        <li>Fixed spelling errors that did not conform to exports.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>March 17, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed incorrect spelling "Hotshot" to "Hot Shot", along with its image name/path</li>
        <li>Added mobile formatting to the homepage and honkai homepage</li>
        <li>Added the changelog/to-do list page, which you are viewing now</li>
        <li>Added changelog/to-do list page to the navbar with a clipboard icon</li>
        <li>Added various backend statistics, not in use yet. These mean nothing without their respective calculations, which will come in a future update</li>
        <li>Shifted repeating key CSS declarations to a new file main.css. Things like navbar/footer have been moved there for uniformity in adjustments, between all pages that use these elements.</li>
        <li>Major code overhaul. Bundled functions by type, moved global vars to data.js under globalRecords</li>
        <li>Added a notification that checks the query string in an import for any invalid items, and lists them so the user will know if an import error occurs that is related to spelling, or lack of an item in my data sets.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>March 13, 2024</h1>

        <li>Added a tremendous amount of mobile formatting adjustments</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where mobile dropdown menus were not centering properly</li>
        <li>Shifted to a fixed height on the mobile navbar, so it wouldn't constantly adjust depending on the scroll state of the page</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the class title was too big for its container depending on the combination in use</li>
        <li>Fixed "Devoured Loop" spelling, was "Devourer Loop"</li>
        <li>Added handling/logic if an import was read to have higher traits spent than the 85 point limit. When such an import is received, it will read backwards up the trait list, and remove points until we reach the 85 point limit</li>
        <li>Fixed an incorrect image path for Singed Ring</li>

        <li>1.0 Export Feature Collaboration with remnant2toolkit.com</li>
        <li>Changed most image filepaths away from imgur links. We crutched pretty hard on imgur when the calc was just a spreadsheet, but now that we're hosting our own service, and since it was technically against imgur TOS to do what we were doing, this marks the shift towards removing all imgur links in use</li>
        <li>Added the images for armor, and adjusted the filepaths away from imgur links. This <i>should</i> be the last of the imgur links</li>

        <li>Added the trait cap functionality, matching it to the limit of 85 points like the game</li>
