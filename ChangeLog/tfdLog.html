    <h1>Sept 4, 2024 - THE TFD CALC INTRO UPDATE</h1>

    We'd technically had character-specific calcs up for Lepic and Bunny, but they were manual value input and nowhere near as user-friendly or the level of work I had put into my remnant calculator. Now, however, I'm going just as indepth on the TFD side of things. This will take time, but today marks the release of our first rough draft of sorts.
    <ul>
        <li>Added a TFD Homepage, as well as a TFD icon on the sidenav bar</li>
        <li>Added a Build Calc page, and removed the Lepic specifc page and merged it into this page. The bunny-specific calc still exists on its own page, I just need to do some conversions in order to move it from the separated page into the general use one, which I will do later.</li>
        <li>Added a "Vash's Builds" page for TFD build like I did with the R2 side of the site.</li>
        <li>Added a shit load of images, files, etc. for everything I'm gonna need for now. Probably going to add a lot more later as well.</li>
    </ul>
