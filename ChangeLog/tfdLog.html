        <li>Added the ability to compare weapon damage with limited comparison targets for now which are the following:
            <ul>
                <li>AVG DMG per shot</li>
                <li>SUM AVG DMG per magazine</li>
            </ul>

</div>
<div>
    <h1>Dec 20, 2024 - THE S2 PART 2/3 - SHAREN & BULLET SIM UDATE</h1>
    The new weapon mods are not included in this update, nor are reload factors for the new feature: bullet simulation. Those will be added next week.
    <ul>
        <h3>CALCULATOR</h3>
        <h4>- NEW</h4>
        <li>Added Sharen along with all associated abilities, transcendent mods, and breakdowns.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to compare weapon mods against ability results, which is mainly for unique weapons and includes but is not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Hailey's Zenith</li>
                <li>Lepic's Overkill</li>
                <li>Freyna's Baptism</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added Bullet Simulation
            <ul>
                <li>This can apply to both firearm breakdowns as well as unique weapon breakdowns as mentioned earlier</li>
                <li>This allows you to map out and chart accurate values to mods that are normally very difficult to visualize or approximate, such as the following
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sharp Precision Shot</li>
                        <li>Mental Focus</li>
                        <li>Real Life Fighter</li>
                        <li>Weak Point Expansion</li>
                        <li>etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Later this will include reload factors but they couldn't ship in this update.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the ability to specify your weak point hit rate next to crit or weakpoint allowance settings.</li>
        <li>Added an averaged weak point hit multiplier to the main stat column.</li>
        <li>Added a new statistic to differentiate between FirearmATK% and debuffed enemies that receive more ATK%, as there is a difference.</li>
        <li>Overhauled most complex mods to have function-based benefits that factor into bullet simulations</li>
        <li>Disabled Secret Garden's damage breakdown for now as burst rifles are complicated for bullet simulation. This will be reenabled later.</li>

        <h3>BOSS STATS</h3>
        <li>Updated the following bosses HP/Stats based on the recent nerfs
            <ul>
                <li>Gluttony</li>
                <li>Molten Fortress</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h4>- FIXES</h4>
        <li>Fixed an issue where some abilities had improperly set comparsion targets, and could break when targeted using the Compare tab</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where some mods couldn't be selected due to an extra space attached to the end of their name</li>
        <li>Fixed various typos on modules.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Dec 14, 2024 - THE S2 UPDATE PART 1/3</h1>
    There are still more character updates and additional mods/gear that will be coming this weekend.<br>
    A large rework to the weapon section is coming soon as well.
    <ul>
        <h3>CALCULATOR</h3>
        <h4>- Reactors</h4>
        <li>Added handling to allow reactor enhancement level specification from 0 to 5
            <ul>
                <li>The default level assumption will always be 2</li>
                <li>The specified level is now saved and added to the URL parameters.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added a toggle called Ultimate that lets you specify whether your reactor is ultimate or not
            <ul>
                <li>This does modify the weapon optimization condition from 60% to 40%</li>
                <li>This also restricts the max enhancement level of a reactor to 2 instead of 5, as rare reactors cannot go beyond lvl 2</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When a new weapon is selected, the following triggers occur in the reactor selection:
            <ul>
                <li>If the weapon is ultimate, the Ulty toggle will be flipped on. If not, it will be flipped off</li>
                <li>The weapon's ammo type will automatically be assigned in the reactor selection, however I still let you as the user change the ammo type on the reactor only because there are still some skill that pull from the reactor ammo type like lepic or freyna when it comes to determining fire rate if you have Sharp Precision Shot on. This will change later, but for now this works.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Renamed the "Reactor Weapon Matched" to "Weapon Condition" under the reactor tab</li>
        <li>Removed the "Weapon Conditions" header that hung over the ammo type selection.</li>

        <h4>- Season 2 Changes</h4>
        <li>Added the new Hunter component set</li>
        <li>Updated calculations for the following characters and their associated changes that released with season 2:
            <ul>
                <li>Viessa</li>
                <li>Jayber</li>
                <li>Luna</li>
                <li>Esiemo</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the following unique weapon abilities for the same reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>Blue Beetle</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h4>- General</h4>
        <li>Updated the main calculator page to use the new boss data system we pushed to the boss stats page yesterday. This means you not only have access to more data on the calculator per boss, but also now have access to Infernal Walker, as well as every boss in normal mode for those who wanted it.
            <ul>
                <li>This means bosses are assigned a single letter suffix in the selections, so Devourer Hard Mode is (H) but normal mode is (N) and Infernal Walker is assigned an (A) as it is Abyss difficulty</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Renamed the following tabs:
            <ul>
                <li>"Player" to "Skills"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Changed the hovered cursor in numerous places to be a pointer hand instead of the standard mouse cursor, in an attempt to make functions clearer where applicable</li>

        

    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Dec 12, 2024 - THE ETA SHOP UPDATE</h1>

    There are still character updates and additional mods/gear that will be coming this weekend.
    <ul>
        <h3>ETA Shop Schedule</h3>
        <li>Added ETAShop under the resources tab of TFD navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Added all data for all upcoming weeks on the ETA shop offerings</li>
        <li>Added a boatload of images relevant to shop offerings</li>

        <h3>BOSS PAGE</h3>
        <li>Changed the formatting of the page to be a selection instead of a list</li>
        <li>Added handling to automatically find and populate all weak points on a boss for the sake of wp modifiers</li>
        <li>Added the following info:
            <ul>
                <li>Boss HP</li>
                <li>A whole lot of other boss stats</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h3>CALCULATOR</h3>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a special weapon was selected (aka: secret garden, the only special weapon the calculator supported) then the URL parameters didn't save the mods as a special weapon but rather as an impact weapon meaning a page refresh would load mods that didn't always match what they should have been since impact and special are handled and ordered differently.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Nov 17, 2024 - THE LUNA CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>CALCULATOR</h3>
        <li>Added Luna to the character dropdown and added breakdowns for all her abilities and transcendent mods
            <ul>
                <li>On top of that, I've added her as the first Team option for buffs. Simply toggle it on, input the Luna's total MP amount, select which buffs are active and which one is enhanced, and it'll populate into your character stats accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the Impact Rounds "Edging Shot" description didn't reflect the proper stat amount at max rank. The mod's stats in the code were right, just an issue on the description.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if Kyle had Last Stand equipped, Superconductivity Thrusters only showed the AVG Last Stand bonus but not on a regular hit or crit.</li>
        <li>Fixed a typo on Arche Concretion</li>
        <li>Fixed a typo on Emergency Measures description</li>

        <h3>BUILDS PAGE</h3>
        <li>Renamed the dropdown that links here, to "Builds & Guides" instead of "Vash's Builds"</li>
        <li>Added a list of all builds and guides made by myself or Lian, and converted it all into a filterable table</li>
        <li>Added the ability to filter the displayed builds by type (guide, build, etc.) or by the entity (executor, bunny, etc.)</li>

        <h3>TFD HOME PAGE</h3>
        <li>Added handling to automatically choose the latest video to use on the home page, assuming I've at least added the video to a database in my code. Before, I had to go in each time and edit the actual homepage HTML, and I disliked doing that.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<!-- <li>Added URL logging for character-specific settings, like say Hailey's cold fury stack count. Those were pretty much the only things left that I didn't add to data persistence yet, but now that is done.</li> -->
 <div>
    <h1>Nov 12, 2024 - THE TOOLTIPS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Finished adding tooltips to the entirety of the main stat column. Not only should there be a brief overview to the stat or how it is calculated, but it will also display a list of all currently selected items, abilities, etc. that CAN contribute to the stat so that way if you're getting numbers you're confused on maybe you forgot you have Secret Garden equipped, you can hover over Power Optimization and it'll tell you the bonus is coming from the Reactor Weapon Match like it should, but it'll also display Secret Garden's weapon ability. If you're curious about where that extra bit of DEF is coming from it'll tell you everything that can add it, so on and so forth.</li>
        <li>Added a restriction ruleset on how the final crit damage multiplier is obtained for both skills and firearms, specifically regarding how it handles its decimal values.
            <ul>
                <li>There's still more to be done here to confirm this is how it actually works, but at a glance things line up how they should with the added rules. If it can be disproven, I'll revert this change, but until then we're rollin with it.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Modified the restriction ruleset on how DEF, not RES, handles its decimals to be in-line with how CDMG handles theirs, which lines up for DEF stuff.</li>
        <li>Removed the "SKILL ATTACK" category from the main column since it only served to house the colossus bonus skill atk stat, and moved it to the power ratios category next to power optimization instead.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where some component substats would not get pulled properly, in particular things like MP recovery modifier or shield regen in combat. Things like HP, MP, and DEF have always worked though, the reason this happened was due to a disconnect in my earlier naming schemes that I changed later but didn't update in that code and never noticed until I was adding tooltips for them.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the UI displayed Esiemo's Madness buff as Skill Power not Power Optimization. The math still used it as Optimization like it should have.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Nov 11, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>Mod Comparisons</h3>
        <li>Added the ability to target generalized player statistics, whereas before you could only target ability aspects.</li>
        <li>Added the following options under "Stat" targets:
            <ul>
                <li>Max HP</li>
                <li>Max Shield</li>
                <li>Max MP</li>
                <li>DEF</li>
                <li>Resist - Fire</li>
                <li>Resist - Chill</li>
                <li>Resist - Toxin</li>
                <li>Resist - Electric</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Moved the comparisons tool up to a new tab at the top called "Compare"</li>
        <li>Reworked the comparison UI to be more mobile friendly.</li>

        <h3>General</h3>
        <li>Added the first batch of tooltips to the main stat column.
            <ul>
                <li>Still more work to be done here and they haven't been added to everything just yet. Also, later I'll have it so it'll not only tell you about the stat but also tell you everything in your gear that is adding to it</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the structure needed to do keyword-color-tagging in descriptions. Now I just need to add all the keys. This is for stuff like Cold Fury in Hailey's Description, in-game it is changed to blue text and highlighted, and that's what this code will do.</li>
        <li>Moved the "Player" and "Enemy" settings to tabs up near where the Character/Weapon display toggle used to be, and changed the toggle to a tabbing system instead to allow me to better manage UI space with new things I might add later.</li>
        <li>Added a display to enemy settings that will notify users of the enemy part weakness as well as weak point bonus if applicable</li>
        <li>The following user inputs will now save to the URL length:
            <ul>
                <li>Reactor Weapon Match (the 1.6x bonus or not)</li>
                <li>Current Display Tab (Character, weapon, team, enemy etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Renamed the "Charge Integration" mods to "Bullet Integration" which used to also be called "Charge Intensive"</li>
        <li>Fixed a mislabeled weakness type on the recently added lvl1 immortality and darkness enemy selections. This was purely a display issue, the weakness type behind the scenes was still correct.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the 60% bonus from the matching reactor weapon didn't show up in the main stat column under power optimization. It still factored into the math as it should have, was just an error in how the UI pulled the numbers.</li>
    
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Nov 9, 2024 - THE DEF FORMULA UPDATE</h1>
    If you're not familiar, we sorted out the actual DEF formula, and this brings changes to the resistances values we use and the resulting values we get from them.
    <a href="https://youtu.be/7fWFPwAflMI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #93CCEA;">See the latest video for better info</a>
    <ul>
        <li>In line with our recent discoveries, we have updated all the resistance values that are displayed and used by the calculator. We should have much more accurate values now.</li>
        <li>Added the following resistance reduction effects now that we can calculate them accurately:
            <ul>
                <li>Nazeistra's Devotion</li>
                <li>Venom Injection's Corrosion (Freyna)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added Power Optimization to be visible in the main stat column under the Power Ratio section.</li>
        <li>Added the following to the enemy resistance selection dropdown
            <ul>
                <li>LvL 1 Legion of Darkness</li>
                <li>LvL 1 Legion of Immortality</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Fixed an issue where Hailey's zenith weapon side damage, on the physical damage, didn't have the right multiplier. This was due to a recent change I made in how ability stats get pulled, so that's my bad.</li>
        <li>Fixed another issue that could pop up when a character was removed while a transcendent mod was equippped.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Swamp Walker's body type was listed as Pierce instead of Burst</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Oct 31, 2024 - THE VIESSA CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Viessa to the character selection, along with breakdowns for all abilities and transcendent mods.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where weapon substat flat attribute attack bonuses could sometimes not reflect in the weapon damage breakdown, more precisely the attribute display wouldn't populate if there was only an attribute attack bonus with no enhancement mods. (thank you turbo for the report)</li>
        <li>Added a structure that will allow me to work on character calculations without altering the code that gets shipped out to the live site each update, that way I don't accidentally ship out part of a character. Keen-eyed code viewers noticed in the last update I accidentally shipped out Viessa's ability functions before Viessa herself, but that is something you'd have only seen in the code. In theory, that shouldn't happen anymore.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a character had a transcendent mod active but the character was removed from the selections, it could break the calculator.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Oct 28, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Nazeistra's Devotion to the weapon dropdown. Its unique ability is not yet factored, but will be soon.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Impact Rounds "Expand Weapon Charge" reflected as a Malachite polarity instead of Cerulean.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Impact Rounds "Weak Point Sight" module did not get properly factored into the weak point damage equation.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Oct 25, 2024 - THE MOD COMPARISONS UPDATE + JAYBER BUT WHO CARES</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>MOD COMPARISONS</h3>

        <li>Added the ability to compare one mod you have selected, against all other possible mods that could fit in that slot, in order to determine if there are better options for your build in that mod slot</li>
        <li>Comparisons only work on abilities right now, and you need to select what ability you want to get values for, as well as what aspect you want to compare with:
            <ul>
                <li>An example would be Lepic's grenade throw. You might want to compare the total damage of a single grenade, or you the DPS of the grenade throw overall while also considering cooldowns. You have to choose what part you want to compare on.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Comparisons will not populate if you have no mods equipped, or if the ability isn't meant to be compared. An example would be an ability that gives you a bonus to your stats but does nothing else, there is no point in comparing what your mods do there.</li>
        <li>Comparisons do not function on transcendent or sub-attack modules, nor do I do comparisons for weapon modules. Yet. Weapons soon though.</li>

        <h3>CALCULATOR</h3>

        <li>Added Jayber to the character selection, along with breakdowns for all abilities and transcendent mods.</li>
        <li>Added a slider to enemy settings, that dictates your Dangerous Ambush (Immobile) uptime. This slider directly modifies the bonus given by the mod, and defaults at 100% so that way people who don't notice it don't get confused by custom amounts.</li>
        <li>Completed all remaining unfinished abilities, transcendent mods, and UI revamp for the following characters, including hook-ups to the mod comparison tool:
            <ul>
                <li>Lepic</li>
                <li>Kyle</li>
                <li>Hailey</li>
                <li>Bunny (her 4th skill at base still needs testing that I'll do later, it's a weird one)</li>
                <li>Esiemo</li>
                <li>Freyna</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added support for the Last Stand mod, specifically in Kyle's Superconductivity Thrusters skill damage.</li>
        <li>Added a toggle to restrict Lepic's overkill duration my the maximum duration that would be allowed by your maximum MP.</li>
        <li>Added support for dynamic sprint speed bonuses on Bunny's Lightning Emission skill, to be modified by the various speed bonuses provided by her other abilities. This will also allow me to factor in sprint speed bonuses provided by weapons or modules in the future.</li>
        <li>Added toggles for each sprint speed bonus provided by any of Bunny's abilities or transcendent mods(even bionic, sadge)</li>
        <li>Added support for all aspects of Esiemo's Madness and Narcissism buffs, so the -DEF, the firearm ATK%, etc. will now factor into character and weapon statistics where applicable.</li>
        <li>Added Duration and Fire Rate restrictions for Freyna's Venom Baptism. This way people can see how many shots they have time for, vs how many shots they can actually manage.</li>
        <li>Added support for Freyna's Venom Injection transcendent mod to check if a 1-HP mod is equipped and force the HP slider down to 0% and ensure the maximum bonus is applied without the user needing to be aware of it. Conversely, if you have no 0-HP mods equipped, the calculator will ensure you cannot go below 15%HP on the slider.</li>
        <li>Added Peace Maker to the weapon dropdown, and added its unique weapon ability to factor in stacks to player stats when applicable.</li>
        <li>Renamed the following settings from "Use" to "Allow" for better clarity in regards to what they do. For example, physical type bonuses or part-specific weak point modifiers will be automatically adjusted or even disabled depening on the target selected and their corresponding weakpoints. "Use" make it sound like it will happen always when selected, but "Allow" implies that when it can happen, you're letting it still factor in:
            <ul>
                <li>"Allow Weak Points?"</li>
                <li>"Allow Crits?"</li>
                <li>"Allow Physical Bonus?"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Maximize Duration had a negative power modifier of -20% instead of the -21.1% it should be.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Lepic's overkill shot count display could be one shot off on edge case duration amounts.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where swapping to Esiemo as your selected character didn't always update the total bombs placed amount correctly.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the description for Blue Beetle's unique ability listed as Secret Garden's. This didn't modify the ability, only the description.</li>
        <li>Fixed a typo on the Transcendent mod overview header</li>

        <h3>BUILDS PAGE</h3>
        <li>Updateds builds page and home page recent video link</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Oct 17, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added an extremely basic damage overview for whatever your selected weapon is, in Weapon Mode. This will be expanded upon more later.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to select a target body part on the enemy selected for resistances:
            <ul>
                <li>Part-specific weakpoint modifiers will now automatically adjust based on the part selected. This also means that if you select Body which obviously can't hit weakpoints, that means weakpoints will also automatically be disabled.</li>
                <li>Part-specific physical type bonuses(crush, pierce, burst) will now automatically adjust based on the part selected. This also means the type bonus will disable automatically when you are selecting a body part with a weakness that is not applicable to the physical type of your weapon. This also means in the future when I add enemy selections for regular vulgus, it will automatically adjust the amount of the type bonus too.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Non-Attribute characters could pop an error when obtaining the Boss DR related to non-attribute, failing to validate the display numbers. This was caused when I made a change to how character abilities retrieve boss DR to apply, and Non-Attribute having a hyphen in the attribute name tripped it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Oct 15, 2024 - THE FREYNA CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>BOSS STATS</h3>
        <li>Added resistances, weak point modifiers, and crit resists for Death Stalker</li>
        <li>Updated Gluttony's new crit resists</li>

        <li>Added ability calculations and breakdowns for Freyna along with all her abilities and Transcendent Mods.</li>
        <li>Added the function to automatically adjust crit resist depending on which boss you have selected. You can still manually adjust crit res after selecting a boss, but when the boss is first selected the crit resist will be adjusted to that boss to save you time.</li>
        <li>Added unique weapon abilities to the following weapons, that will now factor into character and weapon stats:
            <ul>
                <li>Blue Beetle</li>
                <li>Secret Garden</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added Special Rounds modules, purely for the sake of being able to add in Secret Garden support as listed earlier.</li>
        <li>Revamped the ability breakdown UI for the following characters and all their abilities:
            <ul>
                <li>Hailey</li>
                <li>Freyna</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following categories to the main Stats Column:
            <ul>
                <li>Firearm Crit</li>
                <li>Firearm Weak Point</li>
                <li>Firearm ATK</li>
                <li>Firearm Attribute</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following General Settings:
            <ul>
                <li>Use Weakspot Hits</li>
                <li>Use Critical Hits</li>
                <li>Use Physical Type Bonus</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Colossus attibute resistance was not being factored into bunny's Lightning Emission calcs.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Range displays could show the incorrect value in relation to the ability's specific range limit.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if someone was mentally unstable and toggled options at the speed of light, sometimes the options wouldn't toggle properly.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where components with excessively long descriptions could sometimes take up too much space and cause other displays within the components box to get pushed out of view.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Oct 5, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added extra ability statistics (range, cost, etc.) to ALL the abilities of the following characters and their transcendent mods:
            <ul>Esiemo</ul>
        </li>
        <li>Re-enabled the remainder of Esiemo's ability breakdowns that had been disabled after the rework, since I hadn't gotten to all of his skills just yet to confirm values, but now that is done.</li>
        <li>Updated the description of Esiemo's Adventitious Habit passive to reflect the phrasing change to on hit instead of depleted shields.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 30, 2024 - THE ESIEMO CALCS AND BOSS RESISTS UPDATE</h1>
    I had to change a lot of things in this update to make life easier in the future. As such, if you see anything jank, please let me know in the discord.
    <ul>
        <li>Added calculations for Esiemo and ALL his abilities and transcendent mods, and updated ability breakdowns for Kyle
            <ul>
                <li>Most of the math was done before their rework update, so some are temporarily disabled until I can confirm all of their math is still the same, which should not take me very long to do. Only reason they aren't done already is because I was playing Remnant 2's new DLC.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added resistance data for all bosses to the boss stats page, but also added a dropdown on the calculator page to allow users to choose the boss they want to see numbers adjusted to. This means that without needing to go and attack a boss, you can tell how much damage you will deal to it just from lookin at the calc. I'll have a video on this out separately, later.</li>
        <li>Added support for the following ability breakdowns for characters that did not have them before:
            <ul>
                <li>Bunny: Electric Condense</li>
                <li>Bunny: Thrill Bomb</li>
                <li>Hailey: Storm Snare</li>
                <li>Hailey: Cryo Round</li>
                <li>Lepic: Overclock</li>
                <li>Lepic: Power Unit Change</li>
                <li>Lepic: Nerve Infiltration</li>
                <li>Lepic: Traction Grenade</li>
                <li>Lepic: Firearm Master</li>
                <li>Lepic: Regenerative Braking</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Started adding ability specific statistics to each ability breakdown, so say what the range is or maybe an ability has more than 1 range stat to factor in, they'll display in rows beneath the discription.
            <ul>
                <li>I have NOT added this to every ability yet, but I will. Only clarifying this so if you see it pop up on some but not others, that's why. When I add descendant math in the future for new characters, I'll have it already for them, but I'll have to circle back to older additions to my calc and add them.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where URL logging didn't properly retain the values a user input. It kept the stat names correctly, but the values were lost on a page load which would force the value to register as zero, causing the calc to automatically provided the highest values possible for the associated rolls. Note that reactors did not have this issue, only component substat numbers.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where weapon attribute damage on Zenith wouldn't populate for anything but Chill damage</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where on the boss stats page, Gluttony listed its weak point physical types(pierce, burst, etc.) to be the same as Devourer's, which isn't correct. Only the physical type images were incorrect, the rest of of Gluttony's info is fine.</li>
    
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 18, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Renamed the old crit sliders from ceiling to resistance. Forgot to do that after the crit res video.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 17, 2024 - THE HAILEY CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Add URL gear logging. This means that your selections are saved in case you refresh or use the link that it generates in your browser, to open the same build back up later
            <ul>
                <li>Note that right now, character settings, so like Hailey cold fury stacks, are not saved to the URL. I'm still debating how I want to structure character settings in there. If I make it now when I'm not sure how I want to do it, then I'll break it later when I change it to how I want it. Will think for a bit on this part.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added calculations and breakdowns for Hailey and her Zenith skill.
            <ul>
                <li>This includes the first draft of the weapon side of the calculator. Right now it is only for specifying what weapon or stats or mods you're using on your stat stick for hailey, but your selections DO impact her zenith skill damage breakdown.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed several mods that had incorrect polarities in the descendant modules.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 6, 2024 - THE KYLE CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Kyle in the character selection, and added dmg calcs for his 2's transcendant mod and both his 4 and 4's transcendant mod as well.</li>
        <li>Added Kyle Build to the Vash Builds page</li>
        <li>When I published this update, Kyle's 4th transcendant mod still showed the correct numbers instead of the bugged numbers like I talk about in the Kyle video. Shortly after this update went out I put out an update that brought the numbers back to the bugged numbers, as that is the current state of the game. Will change this when it is patched in game.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Dangerous Ambush added together both the non-targeting bonus and the immobilized bonus. Now it only adds the immobilized bonus like it should.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where on the Vash Build's page while the link's names were changed, they still linked to some Remnant 2 videos.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 5, 2024 - BUNNY EMISSION CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    As mentioned yesterday, we had bunny calcs on their own page prior to today, but now we've merged them into the main calc where no manual value input is needed anymore, just say what you're using and look at the numbers.
    <ul>
        <li>Added Bunny as a character option and merged her emission/HV calcs from her character specific page to this main calc. Deleted the old bunny page.</li>
        <li>Added Bunny Transcendant mods.</li>
        <li>Added functionality that will actively add or remove transcendant mods from the available dropdown options in the first mod slot, based on which character you have selected or are switching to.</li>
        <li>Updated the conversion values of Overwhelming HP and Overwhelming Shield as per the game's update today.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that stopped +ATK vs Colossus to factor into skill calculations.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where enough conversion mods could bring your max HP into the negative</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the 12th mod slot could not be returned to after clicking off of it</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where a typo caused the 9th mod slot's stats and description to fail to populate</li>
        <li>Fixed augment descriptions for two of lepic's transcendant mods.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 4, 2024 - THE TFD CALC INTRO UPDATE</h1>

    We'd technically had character-specific calcs up for Lepic and Bunny, but they were manual value input and nowhere near as user-friendly or the level of work I had put into my remnant calculator. Now, however, I'm going just as indepth on the TFD side of things. This will take time, but today marks the release of our first rough draft of sorts.
    <ul>
        <li>Added a TFD Homepage, as well as a TFD icon on the sidenav bar</li>
        <li>Added a Build Calc page, and removed the Lepic specifc page and merged it into this page. The bunny-specific calc still exists on its own page, I just need to do some conversions in order to move it from the separated page into the general use one, which I will do later.</li>
        <li>Added a "Vash's Builds" page for TFD build like I did with the R2 side of the site.</li>
        <li>Added a shit load of images, files, etc. for everything I'm gonna need for now. Probably going to add a lot more later as well.</li>

        <li>Fixed an issue where only 10 mod slots populated instead of 12, due to the augment and sub mods taking up space where they shouldn't have.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Overwhelming HP mod would cause NaN displays on some associated defensive stat displays in the main stat column.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if you swapped a mod in the same slot to another mod that happened to have the same mod category(attack, arche tech, battle, etc.) it would react as if you were selecting a duped category, and clear the selection. Normally this should only happen if you do a dupe mod category in another slot in order to mimic the game's functionality, but swapping in the same mod slot shouldn't have been an issue and now it won't be.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
