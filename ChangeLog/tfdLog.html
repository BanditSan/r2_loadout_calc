    <ul>
        <li>asdf</li>
    </ul>
</div> -->

<!-- <li>Added URL logging for character-specific settings, like say Hailey's cold fury stack count. Those were pretty much the only things left that I didn't add to data persistence yet, but now that is done.</li> -->

<div>
    <h1>Oct 17, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added an extremely basic damage overview for whatever your selected weapon is, in Weapon Mode. This will be expanded upon more later.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to select a target body part on the enemy selected for resistances:
            <ul>
                <li>Part-specific weakpoint modifiers will now automatically adjust based on the part selected. This also means that if you select Body which obviously can't hit weakpoints, that means weakpoints will also automatically be disabled.</li>
                <li>Part-specific physical type bonuses(crush, pierce, burst) will now automatically adjust based on the part selected. This also means the type bonus will disable automatically when you are selecting a body part with a weakness that is not applicable to the physical type of your weapon. This also means in the future when I add enemy selections for regular vulgus, it will automatically adjust the amount of the type bonus too.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Non-Attribute characters could pop an error when obtaining the Boss DR related to non-attribute, failing to validate the display numbers. This was caused when I made a change to how character abilities retrieve boss DR to apply, and Non-Attribute having a hyphen in the attribute name tripped it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Oct 15, 2024 - THE FREYNA CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>BOSS STATS</h3>
        <li>Added resistances, weak point modifiers, and crit resists for Death Stalker</li>
        <li>Updated Gluttony's new crit resists</li>

        <h3>CALCULATOR</h3>
        <li>Added the new "Amplification" and "Intensive" modules</li>
        <li>Added ability calculations and breakdowns for Freyna along with all her abilities and Transcendent Mods.</li>
        <li>Added the function to automatically adjust crit resist depending on which boss you have selected. You can still manually adjust crit res after selecting a boss, but when the boss is first selected the crit resist will be adjusted to that boss to save you time.</li>
        <li>Added unique weapon abilities to the following weapons, that will now factor into character and weapon stats:
            <ul>
                <li>Blue Beetle</li>
                <li>Secret Garden</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added Special Rounds modules, purely for the sake of being able to add in Secret Garden support as listed earlier.</li>
        <li>Revamped the ability breakdown UI for the following characters and all their abilities:
            <ul>
                <li>Hailey</li>
                <li>Freyna</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following categories to the main Stats Column:
            <ul>
                <li>Firearm Crit</li>
                <li>Firearm Weak Point</li>
                <li>Firearm ATK</li>
                <li>Firearm Attribute</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following General Settings:
            <ul>
                <li>Use Weakspot Hits</li>
                <li>Use Critical Hits</li>
                <li>Use Physical Type Bonus</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Colossus attibute resistance was not being factored into bunny's Lightning Emission calcs.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Range displays could show the incorrect value in relation to the ability's specific range limit.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if someone was mentally unstable and toggled options at the speed of light, sometimes the options wouldn't toggle properly.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where components with excessively long descriptions could sometimes take up too much space and cause other displays within the components box to get pushed out of view.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Oct 5, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added extra ability statistics (range, cost, etc.) to ALL the abilities of the following characters and their transcendent mods:
            <ul>Esiemo</ul>
        </li>
        <li>Re-enabled the remainder of Esiemo's ability breakdowns that had been disabled after the rework, since I hadn't gotten to all of his skills just yet to confirm values, but now that is done.</li>
        <li>Updated the description of Esiemo's Adventitious Habit passive to reflect the phrasing change to on hit instead of depleted shields.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 30, 2024 - THE ESIEMO CALCS AND BOSS RESISTS UPDATE</h1>
    I had to change a lot of things in this update to make life easier in the future. As such, if you see anything jank, please let me know in the discord.
    <ul>
        <li>Added calculations for Esiemo and ALL his abilities and transcendent mods, and updated ability breakdowns for Kyle
            <ul>
                <li>Most of the math was done before their rework update, so some are temporarily disabled until I can confirm all of their math is still the same, which should not take me very long to do. Only reason they aren't done already is because I was playing Remnant 2's new DLC.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added resistance data for all bosses to the boss stats page, but also added a dropdown on the calculator page to allow users to choose the boss they want to see numbers adjusted to. This means that without needing to go and attack a boss, you can tell how much damage you will deal to it just from lookin at the calc. I'll have a video on this out separately, later.</li>
        <li>Added support for the following ability breakdowns for characters that did not have them before:
            <ul>
                <li>Bunny: Electric Condense</li>
                <li>Bunny: Thrill Bomb</li>
                <li>Hailey: Storm Snare</li>
                <li>Hailey: Cryo Round</li>
                <li>Lepic: Overclock</li>
                <li>Lepic: Power Unit Change</li>
                <li>Lepic: Nerve Infiltration</li>
                <li>Lepic: Traction Grenade</li>
                <li>Lepic: Firearm Master</li>
                <li>Lepic: Regenerative Braking</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Started adding ability specific statistics to each ability breakdown, so say what the range is or maybe an ability has more than 1 range stat to factor in, they'll display in rows beneath the discription.
            <ul>
                <li>I have NOT added this to every ability yet, but I will. Only clarifying this so if you see it pop up on some but not others, that's why. When I add descendant math in the future for new characters, I'll have it already for them, but I'll have to circle back to older additions to my calc and add them.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where URL logging didn't properly retain the values a user input. It kept the stat names correctly, but the values were lost on a page load which would force the value to register as zero, causing the calc to automatically provided the highest values possible for the associated rolls. Note that reactors did not have this issue, only component substat numbers.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where weapon attribute damage on Zenith wouldn't populate for anything but Chill damage</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where on the boss stats page, Gluttony listed its weak point physical types(pierce, burst, etc.) to be the same as Devourer's, which isn't correct. Only the physical type images were incorrect, the rest of of Gluttony's info is fine.</li>
    
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 18, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Renamed the old crit sliders from ceiling to resistance. Forgot to do that after the crit res video.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 17, 2024 - THE HAILEY CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Add URL gear logging. This means that your selections are saved in case you refresh or use the link that it generates in your browser, to open the same build back up later
            <ul>
                <li>Note that right now, character settings, so like Hailey cold fury stacks, are not saved to the URL. I'm still debating how I want to structure character settings in there. If I make it now when I'm not sure how I want to do it, then I'll break it later when I change it to how I want it. Will think for a bit on this part.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added calculations and breakdowns for Hailey and her Zenith skill.
            <ul>
                <li>This includes the first draft of the weapon side of the calculator. Right now it is only for specifying what weapon or stats or mods you're using on your stat stick for hailey, but your selections DO impact her zenith skill damage breakdown.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed several mods that had incorrect polarities in the descendant modules.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 6, 2024 - THE KYLE CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Kyle in the character selection, and added dmg calcs for his 2's transcendant mod and both his 4 and 4's transcendant mod as well.</li>
        <li>Added Kyle Build to the Vash Builds page</li>
        <li>When I published this update, Kyle's 4th transcendant mod still showed the correct numbers instead of the bugged numbers like I talk about in the Kyle video. Shortly after this update went out I put out an update that brought the numbers back to the bugged numbers, as that is the current state of the game. Will change this when it is patched in game.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Dangerous Ambush added together both the non-targeting bonus and the immobilized bonus. Now it only adds the immobilized bonus like it should.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where on the Vash Build's page while the link's names were changed, they still linked to some Remnant 2 videos.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 5, 2024 - BUNNY EMISSION CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    As mentioned yesterday, we had bunny calcs on their own page prior to today, but now we've merged them into the main calc where no manual value input is needed anymore, just say what you're using and look at the numbers.
    <ul>
        <li>Added Bunny as a character option and merged her emission/HV calcs from her character specific page to this main calc. Deleted the old bunny page.</li>
        <li>Added Bunny Transcendant mods.</li>
        <li>Added functionality that will actively add or remove transcendant mods from the available dropdown options in the first mod slot, based on which character you have selected or are switching to.</li>
        <li>Updated the conversion values of Overwhelming HP and Overwhelming Shield as per the game's update today.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that stopped +ATK vs Colossus to factor into skill calculations.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where enough conversion mods could bring your max HP into the negative</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the 12th mod slot could not be returned to after clicking off of it</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where a typo caused the 9th mod slot's stats and description to fail to populate</li>
        <li>Fixed augment descriptions for two of lepic's transcendant mods.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 4, 2024 - THE TFD CALC INTRO UPDATE</h1>

    We'd technically had character-specific calcs up for Lepic and Bunny, but they were manual value input and nowhere near as user-friendly or the level of work I had put into my remnant calculator. Now, however, I'm going just as indepth on the TFD side of things. This will take time, but today marks the release of our first rough draft of sorts.
    <ul>
        <li>Added a TFD Homepage, as well as a TFD icon on the sidenav bar</li>
        <li>Added a Build Calc page, and removed the Lepic specifc page and merged it into this page. The bunny-specific calc still exists on its own page, I just need to do some conversions in order to move it from the separated page into the general use one, which I will do later.</li>
        <li>Added a "Vash's Builds" page for TFD build like I did with the R2 side of the site.</li>
        <li>Added a shit load of images, files, etc. for everything I'm gonna need for now. Probably going to add a lot more later as well.</li>

        <li>Fixed an issue where only 10 mod slots populated instead of 12, due to the augment and sub mods taking up space where they shouldn't have.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Overwhelming HP mod would cause NaN displays on some associated defensive stat displays in the main stat column.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if you swapped a mod in the same slot to another mod that happened to have the same mod category(attack, arche tech, battle, etc.) it would react as if you were selecting a duped category, and clear the selection. Normally this should only happen if you do a dupe mod category in another slot in order to mimic the game's functionality, but swapping in the same mod slot shouldn't have been an issue and now it won't be.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
