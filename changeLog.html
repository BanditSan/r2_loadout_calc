                    <h1>April 27, 2024 - THE DLC2 ITEMS UPDATE</h1>
                    Queries are my next update. They'll release in a limited beta capacity, puretly for tank searches, for now, but that will be later and hopefully today as well but we'll see.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added all DLC items(barring the Polygun, for now). If you notice anything weird with the calculations, let me know in my discord.</li>
                        <li>Added a hierarchy system to items that have conditionals to ensure they apply in the correct order. In theory this shouldn't change anything as it worked before, this was only necessary so things that had conditionals based on what were normally "final" stats, like Total DR, will calculate properly. As before, if you notice anything jank, let me know.</li>
                        <li>Changed incoming bleed to now be a multiplicative reduction to Healing Effectiveness, instead of additive like it was before. This is a patch change I forgot to make.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where the movement speed granted by Gift of the Unbound was calculating based on the health reduction modifier from its old effect, instead of the new movement speed bonus(so it was granting 20%MS per burden instead of 5% lol)</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where relic use speed wasn't displayed due to an error.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where imports from R2TK could break when an item(specifically ranged weapons) was imported that utilized a custom function.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where Kolket Eyelet was giving 0.03 instead of 0.3 per Bulwark.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where Soul Guard gave the incorrect amount of Bulwark.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>April 23, 2024 - THE PRE-DLC PATCHNOTES PREP UPDATE</h1>
                    Build Queries and Melee DMG are not included in this update. That will be after I do my DLC playthroughs.
                    <ul>
                        <h3><span class="haste">INTERFACE REWORK</span></h3>
                        <li>Main calc UI overhaul: Condensed accessories, consumables, weapons, and all item selections into one zone which used to be only for archetype selections. This allows us to bump trait selection up to the main UI row, and delete the 2nd UI row entirely.</li>
                        <li>Item toggles are now displayed within each item's "selected" state. This is when the item's loadout slot is clicked or tapped.</li>
                        <li>Trait section now displays circles just like in game instead of a segmented progress bar. Trait level can be assigned through manual input, or through clicking/tapping the circle that corresponds to the desired level.</li>
                        <li>Changed all Checkboxes, to Toggled Sliders. This is far more mobile friendly.</li>
                        <li>Changed the site to follow the "Montserrat" Font to closer follow the game's UI</li>
                        <li>Added regex filtering to include numbers within descriptions. No matter the units used(seconds, meters, %, etc) they will now be emboldened like the game UI.</li>

                        <h3>CALCULATIONS & ADJUSTMENTS</h3>
                        <li>Modified all item statistics and custom functions as best I could, to match pre-release patch notes. I say best I could as the patchnotes were not incredibly specific on every change that happened, some mention value changes but not how much. As such, many values remain unchained until we can get the DLC update to see what the new values are.</li>
                        <li><span class="haste">HASTE</span> is now calculated and its bonuses displayed where relevant</li>
                        <li>Added support for up to 4 quick-use consumables. Before I only supported 2 because I firmly believed there were never more than 2 that related to tanking, but now that we're moving beyond tanking I obviously need to change that. Rejoice, anyone who imported builds with more than 4 quick-use from R2TK.</li>
                        <li>Added conditional calculations for over 40 items. If I was able to make it conditional without being too excessive, then I did it. Stuff like Alchemy Stone or even Embrace of Sha'hala no longer provide their bonuses implicitly. I tried to specify within item descriptions if the condition was assumed to always be true, so if you don't see that then you can generally assume that there is a conditional associated, but I might have forgotten a few so let me know.</li>
                        <li>Added outgoing/incoming status effects, based on what your build is, for the sake of conditional calculations mentioned above. An example: Atonement Fold provides <span class="bleed">BLEEDING</span> as an incoming status to the player. The player now counts as an entity afflicted with both a negative <span class="status">STATUS</span> effect, and a <span class="bleed">BLEEDING</span> status effect.</li>
                        <li>Added advanced stats settings for: Enemy Count, Grey Health Active, Perfect Dodge, Evade dodge override(otherwise it assumes it is a normal dodge/roll, not an evade/backstep)</li>
                        <li>Added the distinction between stamina cost and action cost, as not all stamina cost reductions are the same thing
                            <ul>So as an example:
                                <li>Evades cost 25 stamina at base. Say you have 20% reduced evade cost, this is an action cost reduction, and applies to the base cost of the action BEFORE stamina cost penalties or bonuses are applied.</li>
                                This logic applies to all stamina-related actions and their associated action-cost specific stats.
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Removed stats from Samoflange. It used to only show the negative DR gained in the downtime, but I agree that isn't fair to do since it does have a positive. However, even if we average the DR gained over time using the bonus and the negative, you're still a hair under 0% DR gained and negative. As such, it is simplest to just stop the item from adding anything anymore. Why in the hell would you be using that thing anyways.</li>
                        <li>Removed the ability to toggle calculations for relic fragments, and traits. These were mainly there for when this was still a spreadsheet so you could verify the source was providing what it should be, but for fragments all you need to do to do that is remove the fragment, and for traits just unrank them. I may add this back later if I find a good way to incorporate it into the UI that isn't pointless, but for now they go.</li>
                        <li>Removed Wayfarer and Resonance, and merged them with Swiftness and Amplitude, respecitvely. Added support for multi-benefit, separately-scaling traits in the calculations.</li>
                        <li>Adjusted stamina penalty calculations for Verdant Tea. It doesn't list it as such within the game, but it does reduce the weight-cost penalty. Upddated the description on my end to reflect that.</li>
                        <li>Made slight changes to the overall save structure of the URL parameters. If you notice anything weird let me know immediately. It will probably screw with people who had a complex relic input saved in the URL for Resonating Heart, as that setting is now fully calculated without user input and the save slot has been replaced by enemyCount</li>

                        <h3>FIXES</h3>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where the trait "Bloodstream" didn't have a level 0 value defined, and as such would break the GHP/s display when selected at level 0</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where Game Master's Pride was not calculating shared damage correctly. I'm amazed nobody noticed before frankly, but that was a mistake on my part.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where <span class="shield">SHIELD</span> EHP did not properly calculate when Restriction Cord was selected. This was because Restriction Cord does not actually cut your HP in half for the purposes of shielding, it only prevents you from healing past half.</li>
                        <li>Fixed a typo with A'Taerii Booster where the T was not capitalized. As lower case this caused some exclusion flags when importing from Remnant2Toolkit.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where weight summary display values did not properly reflect their weight class color when they rested exactly on the cusp of a threshold.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where if a melee was selected that utilized a custom functcion for conditionial stats, it would prevent imports from working correclty from R2TK</li>
                        
                        <h3>OPTIMIZATION</h3>
                        <li>Optimized code to reduce redundant formula calls. You won't even be able to notice this on the main calculator, but for Build Queries when you get them, a lot happened here. Still more to do though, this has been a learning project for me.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 24, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added a small banner that displays when the calc was last updated, based on the last push made to the github master branch. This is just so if an update comes to the game, and you guys are curious if I've added something, you can 1) see this changelog anyways, but 2) you can now see when the last time I touched it, was.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 23, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where traits with multiple benefits could freeze the calculator(Shadeskin, Handling, etc)</li>
                        <li>Added missing stats for Explorer's Gold Digger ability. Note though that this means all bonuses granted by any Fountain will be considered active at all times while the ability is left toggled as on. I do not intend to add ability-bonus individual substat toggles, ability toggles themselves are already enough, use your head when abilities have more than one benefit that may not be guaranteed active at all times during ability use.</li>
                        <li>Fixed descriptions still having a hyphen in "Fire-Rate", this was leftover from the old regex filter I used in substat color tagging, but is no longer necessary. </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 22, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>Barring any crazy bugs you find that need immediate fixing, this is probably the last set of minor fixes to come, before I get damage calculations set up and rolling for at least melee.<br>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where lifesteal's display values were rounding off one digit too soon. This didn't actually change the values, only the displays(not that lifesteal is even used in any calculations front-end yet, idk why I'm even clarifying)</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where the calculator would not recognize if it was opened from another section of the site, causing it to notify you of an import when there obviously was none</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 21, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed built-in melee mods not getting cleared when the weapon was no longer selected</li>
                        <li>Major code overhaul: rewrote trait logic, cut out a lot of code in the process. Nothing should change on the user end, just think of it as housecleaning.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 20, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added built-in gun mods. As such, imports from R2TK using these will no longer flag an exclusion notification</li>
                        <li>Fixed image for Dull Steel Ring</li>
                        <li>Finalized regex filter used for substat color tagging. I can now add to a list of exclusions specific to substat tags, for better and more efficient handling.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 19, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added substat color tagging. So stuff like <span style="color: #f9ebb8;">BULWARK</span> or <span style="color: #7171a7;">OVERLOADED</span>, that kind of stuff now will adjust color accordingly within descriptions.</li>
                        <li>Improved regex filter used in the aforementioned point, to exclude compounded words or words with ":" or "-". This way fire-rate does not get modified just because it has fire in it and the hyphen wasn't recognized.</li>
                        <li>Added all backend statistics and custom item functions(if applicable) for the following categories. These were previously partially ignored as the skipped stats had nothing to do with tanking, EHP, or survivability in general.
                            <br>Some of these additions will reflect right now, such as Shadeskin, but a lot of these don't have displays hooked up yet.
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Relic Fragments</li>
                            <li>Traits</li>
                            <li>Concoctions/Consumables</li>
                            <li>Melee Mutators</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Added array handling for traits with multiple benefits, such as Shadeskin, or Handling. This is unique to Traits as they have levels as well as properties.</li>
                        <li>Added missing image for Onyx Pendulum</li>
                        <li>Added missing consumable descriptions, for the items that were added yesterday</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Added custom, dynamic item functions for amulets AND rings. So like Daredevil's Charm, Gift of the Unbound, etc. Not everything will be perfect, not everything this does is even visible right now, but it's there for later.</li>
                        <li>Added missing consumables, even if they don't have a place yet.</li>
                        <li>Change settings Toggles icon to orange because people are blind and didn't know it existed. TELL ME YOU CAN'T SEE IT NOW.</li>
                        <li>Fixed spelling errors that did not conform to exports.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed incorrect spelling "Hotshot" to "Hot Shot", along with its image name/path</li>
                        <li>Added mobile formatting to the homepage and honkai homepage</li>
                        <li>Added the changelog/to-do list page, which you are viewing now</li>
                        <li>Added changelog/to-do list page to the navbar with a clipboard icon</li>
                        <li>Added various backend statistics, not in use yet. These mean nothing without their respective calculations, which will come in a future update</li>
                        <li>Shifted repeating key CSS declarations to a new file main.css. Things like navbar/footer have been moved there for uniformity in adjustments, between all pages that use these elements.</li>
                        <li>Major code overhaul. Bundled functions by type, moved global vars to data.js under globalRecords</li>
                        <li>Added a notification that checks the query string in an import for any invalid items, and lists them so the user will know if an import error occurs that is related to spelling, or lack of an item in my data sets.</li>

                        <li>Fixed "Devoured Loop" spelling, was "Devourer Loop"</li>
                        <li>Added handling/logic if an import was read to have higher traits spent than the 85 point limit. When such an import is received, it will read backwards up the trait list, and remove points until we reach the 85 point limit</li>
                        <li>Fixed an incorrect image path for Singed Ring</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>1.0 Export Feature Collaboration with remnant2toolkit.com</li>
                        <li>Changed most image filepaths away from imgur links. We crutched pretty hard on imgur when the calc was just a spreadsheet, but now that we're hosting our own service, and since it was technically against imgur TOS to do what we were doing, this marks the shift towards removing all imgur links in use</li>
                        <li>Added the images for armor, and adjusted the filepaths away from imgur links. This <i>should</i> be the last of the imgur links</li>
                        <li>Fixed minor width issues with Firefox. Firefox is hellscape that breaks all my formatting, and there's still lots to do here in the future</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Added the ability for external sources to import builds</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where traits were not populated correctly</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where imported build notifications were shown when not relevant.</li>
                        <li>Added URL item logging. Now, all selections are stored in and actively modify the URL. This means that the link can be used to "share" the build if needed.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where URL logging did not actively modify the URL correctly</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where concoction limit was not being honored by URL logging</li>
                        <li>Decoded %2C back to commas within the URL logging, to reduce query string length</li>
                        <li>Added URL logging for toggles, and advanced stat settings. Now EVERYTHING is saved in a URL if sharing is needed in its current state, settings and all, settings no longer have to be rechecked upon pageload</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Trait dropdowns now exclude what has already been selected in other boxes</li>
                        <li>Fixed an error that would occur if the user generated more than 20 traits. This was due to the toggles being generated based on the prior limit of 20 traits, toggles are now generated automatically according to the current amount of active traits</li>
                        <li>Added the trait cap functionality, matching it to the limit of 85 points like the game</li>
                        <li>Added smol qol feature to delete a trait if it were level 0 and the "-" adjustment was clicked. Traits at this stage will display a trash can icon instead of a "-" symbol on the button</li>
                        <li>Added styling and additional logic to autopopulated traits</li>

                        <li>Fixed an issue when certain browser extensions modified html with injections/parse, the trait generation box would not populate correctly.</li>

                        <li>Alphabetized selector element lists</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue for when relics were selected that did not provide direct healing(eg: Lifesteal, Shields)</li>
                        <li>Optimized dupe/swap handling, added the same logic to quickuse, mods, and mutators</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Calculation tooltips. It'd be best if you guys can see exactly how I'm getting that number, so you can stop asking me how I'm getting it. Kinda low priority at the moment though, there are more important things that need to be done right now.</li>
                        <li>Make Blood Bond's values only populate when the selected summon count is greater than 0. I have it set up to where I could do this now, I'm just not certain how I want to give the user visual feedback to let them know that it won't calculate otherwise. Thinking on this one.</li>
                        <li>Damage Calculations: <b>Monster Task</b>. Almost done with melee calcs</li>
                        <li>Loadouts - Not entirely positive how I want to do this yet, but I do know that a build calculator without the ability to compare one build to another, is kinda sad</li>
                        <li>Make melee mod slots hide when a melee is selected with no built-in mod. On that same note, I'll eventually add the ability to remove mod/mutator slots from Rusted guns, as they have none in game.</li>
                        <li>Change Spirit Healer Stacks to a number input, instead of a number slider.</li>
                        <li>Get better images, now that we are displaying them in a larger size with the new UI.</li>
                        <li>Add enemy count as a factor for Challenger perks.</li>
                        <li>Adjust basics stats column to only display healing/DR related statistics if they exist. Those sections display everything as a remnant from when this was a spreadsheet, but it can be dynamic now.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>Might Do:</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add fragment level specification so people aren't forced into Mythic level assumptions. This is kind of a cancerous task though, and not really worth it. If I do end up doing this, and can't find the values for all levels, I might have to allow user input to specify level values but it just seems like a pedantic amount of customization, and if I do that then what next? Allowing weapon level specification? Blegh, no</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Expanded builds sharing logic</li>
                        <li>Accounts/sign-ins(with the singular exception of allowing loadout saves later, possibly, but likely no)</li>
                        <li>Anything that far exceeds the bounds of a <i><b>calculator</b></i></li>
