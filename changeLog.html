                    <h1>March 23, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where traits with multiple benefits could freeze the calculator(Shadeskin, Handling, etc)</li>
                        <li>Added missing stats for Explorer's Gold Digger ability. Note though that this means all bonuses granted by any Fountain will be considered active at all times while the ability is left toggled as on. I do not intend to add ability-bonus individual substat toggles, ability toggles themselves are already enough, use your head when abilities have more than one benefit that may not be guaranteed active at all times during ability use.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 22, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>Barring any crazy bugs you find that need immediate fixing, this is probably the last set of minor fixes to come, before I get damage calculations set up and rolling for at least melee.<br>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where lifesteal's display values were rounding off one digit too soon. This didn't actually change the values, only the displays(not that lifesteal is even used in any calculations front-end yet, idk why I'm even clarifying)</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where the calculator would not recognize if it was opened from another section of the site, causing it to notify you of an import when there obviously was none</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 21, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed built-in melee mods not getting cleared when the weapon was no longer selected</li>
                        <li>Major code overhaul: rewrote trait logic, cut out a lot of code in the process. Nothing should change on the user end, just think of it as housecleaning.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 20, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added built-in gun mods. As such, imports from R2TK using these will no longer flag an exclusion notification</li>
                        <li>Fixed image for Dull Steel Ring</li>
                        <li>Finalized regex filter used for substat color tagging. I can now add to a list of exclusions specific to substat tags, for better and more efficient handling.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 19, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added substat color tagging. So stuff like <span style="color: #f9ebb8;">BULWARK</span> or <span style="color: #7171a7;">OVERLOADED</span>, that kind of stuff now will adjust color accordingly within descriptions.</li>
                        <li>Improved regex filter used in the aforementioned point, to exclude compounded words or words with ":" or "-". This way fire-rate does not get modified just because it has fire in it and the hyphen wasn't recognized.</li>
                        <li>Added all backend statistics and custom item functions(if applicable) for the following categories. These were previously partially ignored as the skipped stats had nothing to do with tanking, EHP, or survivability in general.
                            <br>Some of these additions will reflect right now, such as Shadeskin, but a lot of these don't have displays hooked up yet.
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Relic Fragments</li>
                            <li>Traits</li>
                            <li>Concoctions/Consumables</li>
                            <li>Melee Mutators</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Added array handling for traits with multiple benefits, such as Shadeskin, or Handling. This is unique to Traits as they have levels as well as properties.</li>
                        <li>Added missing image for Onyx Pendulum</li>
                        <li>Added missing consumable descriptions, for the items that were added yesterday</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 18, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added custom, dynamic item functions for amulets AND rings. So like Daredevil's Charm, Gift of the Unbound, etc. Not everything will be perfect, not everything this does is even visible right now, but it's there for later.</li>
                        <li>Added missing consumables, even if they don't have a place yet.</li>
                        <li>Change settings Toggles icon to orange because people are blind and didn't know it existed. TELL ME YOU CAN'T SEE IT NOW.</li>
                        <li>Fixed spelling errors that did not conform to exports.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 17, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed incorrect spelling "Hotshot" to "Hot Shot", along with its image name/path</li>
                        <li>Added mobile formatting to the homepage and honkai homepage</li>
                        <li>Added the changelog/to-do list page, which you are viewing now</li>
                        <li>Added changelog/to-do list page to the navbar with a clipboard icon</li>
                        <li>Added various backend statistics, not in use yet. These mean nothing without their respective calculations, which will come in a future update</li>
                        <li>Shifted repeating key CSS declarations to a new file main.css. Things like navbar/footer have been moved there for uniformity in adjustments, between all pages that use these elements.</li>
                        <li>Major code overhaul. Bundled functions by type, moved global vars to data.js under globalRecords</li>
                        <li>Added a notification that checks the query string in an import for any invalid items, and lists them so the user will know if an import error occurs that is related to spelling, or lack of an item in my data sets.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Reformat for the skills areas</li>
                        <li>Added missing ":" on mod header</li>
                        <li>Fixed font-size on mod/mutator selector elements</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where advanced stats relic healing was not displayed properly</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where EHP/s was not factoring in relic healing properly</li>
                        <li>Added basic melee statistics to data.js</li>
                        <li>Added display handling for the aforementioned statistics, which will now display on the rows underneath the weapon</li>
                        <li>Added images and descriptions for all built-in melee mods. These will now populate when the associated melee weapon is selected</li>

                    <h1>March 12, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reformat for: Armor, Weapons, Relic, Accessory, and Prime Perk sections</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where the main body wasn't centering properly relative to the space leftover from the navbar</li>
                        <li>Added a tremendous amount of mobile formatting adjustments</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where mobile dropdown menus were not centering properly</li>
                        <li>Shifted to a fixed height on the mobile navbar, so it wouldn't constantly adjust depending on the scroll state of the page</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where the class title was too big for its container depending on the combination in use</li>
                        <li>Fixed "Devoured Loop" spelling, was "Devourer Loop"</li>
                        <li>Added handling/logic if an import was read to have higher traits spent than the 85 point limit. When such an import is received, it will read backwards up the trait list, and remove points until we reach the 85 point limit</li>
                        <li>Fixed an incorrect image path for Singed Ring</li>

                    <h1>March 11, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1.0 Export Feature Collaboration with remnant2toolkit.com</li>
                        <li>Changed most image filepaths away from imgur links. We crutched pretty hard on imgur when the calc was just a spreadsheet, but now that we're hosting our own service, and since it was technically against imgur TOS to do what we were doing, this marks the shift towards removing all imgur links in use</li>
                        <li>Added the images for armor, and adjusted the filepaths away from imgur links. This <i>should</i> be the last of the imgur links</li>
                        <li>Fixed minor width issues with Firefox. Firefox is hellscape that breaks all my formatting, and there's still lots to do here in the future</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>March 10, 2024</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added the ability for external sources to import builds</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where traits were not populated correctly</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where imported build notifications were shown when not relevant.</li>
                        <li>Added URL item logging. Now, all selections are stored in and actively modify the URL. This means that the link can be used to "share" the build if needed.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where URL logging did not actively modify the URL correctly</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where concoction limit was not being honored by URL logging</li>
                        <li>Decoded %2C back to commas within the URL logging, to reduce query string length</li>
                        <li>Added URL logging for toggles, and advanced stat settings. Now EVERYTHING is saved in a URL if sharing is needed in its current state, settings and all, settings no longer have to be rechecked upon pageload</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Trait dropdowns now exclude what has already been selected in other boxes</li>
                        <li>Fixed an error that would occur if the user generated more than 20 traits. This was due to the toggles being generated based on the prior limit of 20 traits, toggles are now generated automatically according to the current amount of active traits</li>
                        <li>Added the trait cap functionality, matching it to the limit of 85 points like the game</li>
                        <li>Added smol qol feature to delete a trait if it were level 0 and the "-" adjustment was clicked. Traits at this stage will display a trash can icon instead of a "-" symbol on the button</li>
                        <li>Added styling and additional logic to autopopulated traits</li>

                        <li>Finish mobile support. This would mainly entail swapping all checkboxes, to slider toggles, but beyond that mobile is pretty much exactly where I want it for now</li>
                        <li>Damage Calculations: <b>Monster Task</b></li>
                        <li>Loadouts - Not entirely positive how I want to do this yet, but I do know that a build calculator without the ability to compare one build to another, is kinda sad</li>
                        <li>Restructure consumables area so the selection boxes only generated when needed/no others exist, like Traits do. Also allow quick-use consumables to handle 4 selections, instead of 2(in-game has 4 slots, 4 is a reasonable limit)</li>

                        <li>Add fragment level specification so people aren't forced into Mythic level assumptions. This is kind of a cancerous task though, and not really worth it. If I do end up doing this, and can't find the values for all levels, I might have to allow user input to specify level values but it just seems like a pedantic amount of customization, and if I do that then what next? Allowing weapon level specification? Blegh, no</li>
